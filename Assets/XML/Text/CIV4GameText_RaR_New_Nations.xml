		<English>[TAB]There are two main groups referred to as Eskimo: Yupik and Inuit. A third group, the Aleut, is related. The Yupik language dialects and cultures in Alaska and eastern Siberia have evolved in place beginning with the original (pre-Dorset) Eskimo culture that developed in Alaska. Approximately 4,000 years ago the Unangam (also known as Aleut) culture became distinctly separate, and evolved into a non-Eskimo culture. Approximately 1,500-2,000 years ago, apparently in Northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. The Inuit language branch became distinct and in only several hundred years spread across northern Alaska, Canada and into Greenland. At about the same time, the Thule Technology also developed in northwestern Alaska and very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo people, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.[PARAGRAPH:1]The earliest known Eskimo cultures were Pre-Dorset Technology, which appear to have been a fully developed Eskimo culture that dates to 5,000 years ago. They appear to have evolved in Alaska from people using the Archaic Small Tools Technology, who probably had migrated to Alaska from Siberia at least 2 to 3 thousand years earlier; though they might have been in Alaska as far back as 10 to 12 thousand years or more. There are similar artifacts found in Siberia going back to perhaps 18,000 years ago. It is believed that the Mongols, Eskimos, and probably the Korean people too all share a common ancestor in northern Asia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Today the two main groups of Eskimos are the Inuit of northern Alaska, Canada and Greenland, and the Yupik, comprising speakers of four distinct Yupik languages and originating in western Alaska, in South Central Alaska along the Gulf of Alaska coast, and in the Russian Far East.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Als Inuit bezeichnen sich die indigenen Volksgruppen, die im arktischen Zentral- und Nordostkanada sowie auf Gr&#246;nland leben. Die Bezeichnung Eskimo wird als Oberbegriff benutzt, der auch die entfernter verwandten arktischen Volksgruppen der Yupik und der Aleuten umfasst. Die Sprache der Inuit ist Inuktitut (Nordostkanada und Gr&#246;nland) und Inuinnaqtun (arktisches Zentralkanada). [PARAGRAPH:1]Die Herkunft der Vorfahren der Inuit ist nicht genau bekannt. Bei Inuit-Kleinkindern tritt (wie bei Indianer-Kindern) h&#228;ufig der Mongolenfleck auf, was durchaus auf eine Verwandtschaft mit heutigen altaischen V&#246;lkern hindeuten kann. Als sicher gilt heute, dass Pal&#228;o-Eskimo etwa 3000 v. Chr. (lange nach der letzten, etwa 10000 v. Chr. endenden Eiszeit) von Asien aus &#252;ber die Beringstra&#223;e nach Alaska (Nordamerika) einwanderten. Sie sind nach einhelliger arch&#228;ologischer Auffassung mindestens 12.000 Jahre sp&#228;ter als die ersten pal&#228;oindianischen Gruppen auf den amerikanischen Kontinent gelangt. Gegen 2500 v. Chr. (das Klima der Arktis war damals w&#228;rmer als heute) wanderte ein Teil der Pal&#228;o-Eskimo von Alaska bis nach Gr&#246;nland. In dieser Zeit entwickelte sich die Pr&#228;-Dorset-Kultur (mit den Independence-Kulturen I und II sowie der Saqqaq-Kultur). Sp&#228;ter - etwa 500 v. Chr. bis 1000 n. Chr. - folgte dann die Dorset-Kultur (benannt nach der heutigen S&#252;dbaffin-Siedlung Cape Dorset, in deren N&#228;he arch&#228;ologische Fundst&#252;cke entdeckt wurden).</German>

Verheiratet mit Mikak, die aufgrund ihres k&#252;rzlichen Aufenthaltes in England, den Moravian Missionaren gut bekannt war, diente Tuglawina als F&#252;hrer um einen Ort f&#252;r die Nain Mission und die Hoffenthal Mission zu finden. [PARAGRAPH:1] Nach der Trennung von Mikak nahm sich Tuglawina weitere Frauen. Gegeb 1782 hatte er vier Ehefrauen, was ein grosses Zeichen des Erfolges und Standarsymbol darstellte, da selbst die erfolgreichsten Inuit meist nur zwei und in seltenen F&#228;llen drei Ehefrauen hatten. Tuglawina wurde ein erfolgreicher Mittelsmann im Austausch von Rechten f&#252;r Fischgr&#252;nde oder Seehundjagdgr&#252;nde gegen Waffen und Schiesspulver, wie auch im Handel mit G&#252;tern f&#252;r die Inuit n&#246;rdlich der Missionen und Rohstoffen f&#252;r die s&#252;dlicher lebenden Europ&#228;er. Trotz - oder vielleicht auch gerade aufgrund - seines Erfolges verliessen ihn viele seiner Anh&#228;nger und Tuglawina wurde von dem Gedanken besessen, seine Gegner w&#252;rden sich zur Rache, aufgrund seiner Rolle bei Morden von rivalisierenden Inuit Jahre zuvor, verschw&#246;ren.[PARAGRAPH:1] Gegen 1790 beendete Tuglawina seine Handelsunternehmungen und zog mit einer verbliebenen Frau in die Mission von Nain. 1783 getauft, wurde er ein starker Verfechter des Christentums. 1798 starb er an Rippenfellentz&#252;ndung und wurde auf dem Missionsfriedhof begraben. </German>

		<English>[TAB]The Huron, who are also known as the Wyandot, originally inhabited the area of central Ontario. Little is known of the history of the Huron's before the arrival of the French upon the shores of the St. Lawrence in 1535. [PARAGRAPH:1] Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, the Huron may of numbered as many as 40,000 people. French estimates of the four core tribes that made up the Huron Confederacy in 1615 numbered the Huron population from 20,000 -30,000 spread throughout 16-25 villages. However, European contact proved devastating for the Huron, and by 1640 successive epidemics and wars had reduced their number to less than 10,000. In 1609, the Huron entered into a loose military and economic alliance with the French against the Iroquois. This allowed the Huron to eventually become the preferred trading partner of the French, and to act as intermediaries between the French and other trading tribes. War with their long standing enemy the Iroquois, continued throughout the early part of the 17th Century until 1649-50, when the Iroquois armed with guns supplied from Dutch and English colonies overrun the Huron, driving them from their lands. Those that survived split into two groups. The first group migrated to Lorette, just north of Quebec, while the remaining Huron that had merged with the Tionontati, Erie and Neutral tribes, endured a harsh nomadic existence for the remainder of the century traveling through present day Wisconsin, Minnesota and upper Michigan. [PARAGRAPH:1] By the early 1700's the Huron had moved to the Ohio Valley, where they aided the French during the Fox Wars 1712-16 and 1728-33. Switching allegiance between the French and the British over the next 20 years, the Huron sided with the French during the French and Indian War 1754-63, and then sided with the British against the Americans during the American Revolutionary War 1775-83. Each succeeding war took its toll on the Huron's and by the end of the 1780s they had been reduced to little over a 100 warriors. [PARAGRAPH:1] The Huron continued to remain in the Ohio Valley until the 1840's when they were removed to Kansas. The Huron living in the United States today are known as Wyandot and are to be found primarily in Kansas and Oklahoma.</English>

French estimates of the four core tribes that made up the Huron Confederacy in 1615 numbered the Huron population from 20,000 -30,000 spread throughout 16-25 villages. However, European contact proved devastating for the Huron, and by 1640 successive epidemics and wars had reduced their number to less than 10,000. In 1609, the Huron entered into a loose military and economic alliance with the French against the Iroquois. This allowed the Huron to eventually become the preferred trading partner of the French, and to act as intermediaries between the French and other trading tribes. War with their long standing enemy the Iroquois, continued throughout the early part of the 17th Century until 1649-50, when the Iroquois armed with guns supplied from Dutch and English colonies overrun the Huron, driving them from their lands. Those that survived split into two groups. The first group migrated to Lorette, just north of Quebec, while the remaining Huron that had merged with the Tionontati, Erie and Neutral tribes, endured a harsh nomadic existence for the remainder of the century traveling through present day Wisconsin, Minnesota and upper Michigan. [PARAGRAPH:1] By the early 1700's the Huron had moved to the Ohio Valley, where they aided the French during the Fox Wars 1712-16 and 1728-33. Switching allegiance between the French and the British over the next 20 years, the Huron sided with the French during the French and Indian War 1754-63, and then sided with the British against the Americans during the American Revolutionary War 1775-83. Each succeeding war took its toll on the Huron's and by the end of the 1780s they had been reduced to little over a 100 warriors. [PARAGRAPH:1] The Huron continued to remain in the Ohio Valley until the 1840's when they were removed to Kansas. The Huron living in the United States today are known as Wyandot and are to be found primarily in Kansas and Oklahoma.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Die Huronen (oder Wyandot oder Wendat - f&#252;r die Zeit bis um 1700 ist die vom franz&#246;sischen hurons abgeleitete Bezeichnung Huronen gel&#228;ufig) waren, als die ersten Europ&#228;er im 16. Jahrhundert mit ihnen Kontakt aufnahmen, eine Konf&#246;deration von f&#252;nf indianischen Ethnien. Sie sprachen eine der irokesischen Sprachen. Zu den Wyandot z&#228;hlten etwa 30.000 Menschen, doch durch Pockenepidemien und die Biberkriege (1640-1701) brach die Bev&#246;lkerungszahl zusammen - in Kanada bis 1760 auf etwa hundert Menschen. Andere, ebenfalls versprengte Gruppen schlossen sich Wyandotgruppen an, doch mussten diese s&#252;dlicheren Gruppen innerhalb der USA westw&#228;rts ziehen. [PARAGRAPH:1] Urspr&#252;nglich waren die Wyandot Teil des irokesischen Volkes, trennten sich aber von diesem und verb&#252;ndeten sich mit Algonkin-V&#246;lkern. Wie die Irokesen lebten sie in Langh&#228;usern und betrieben Landwirtschaft. Gegen 1300 schlossen sich mehrere Clans zusammen und bildeten die Attignawantan (Attignousntan), die innerhalb der sich bildenden Wyandot-Konf&#246;deration der beherrschende und gr&#246;&#223;te Stamm werden sollten. Um 1420 schlossen sich diesen die Attingneenangnahoc an, und diese beiden St&#228;mme gr&#252;ndeten die Wyandot-Konf&#246;deration. Als Hauptstadt wurde Ossossane gew&#228;hlt, die gr&#246;&#223;te Siedlung der Attignawantan. Mit der Verbreitung und dem teilweisen Abzug der Sankt-Lorenz-Irokesen aus dem &#246;stlichen Ontario schlossen sich 1560 die Arendahronon sowie 1570 die Tahontaenrat (Tohonaenrat) der Konf&#246;deration an. Jeder Stamm sandte Repr&#228;sentanten zum gemeinsamen Rat in Ossossane, in dem &#252;ber Krieg und Frieden, B&#252;ndnisse sowie Handel und Jagd beraten wurde. Auf dem H&#246;hepunkt ihrer Macht geh&#246;rten dem Rat der Wyandot etwa 52 Mitglieder an. [PARAGRAPH:1] Bald nach Ankunft der Franzosen, ihren langj&#228;hrigen Verb&#252;ndeten, erlangten sie eine beherrschende Stellung im Fellhandel. Doch die Franzosen hatten sich hierdurch die m&#228;chtige Irokesen-Liga zum Feind gemacht, die sich im Covenant Chain mit den Engl&#228;ndern verb&#252;ndeten und von diesen (wie zuvor von den Niederl&#228;ndern) mit Waffen versorgt wurden. Dies gab den zahlenm&#228;&#223;ig schw&#228;cheren Irokesen eine enorme milit&#228;rische Schlagkraft gegen&#252;ber den sie umgebenden St&#228;mmen, zumal die Wyandot 1639 schwer von einer Pockenepidemie getroffen wurden. Besonders die Mohawk stiegen durch diese K&#228;mpfe zu den wichtigsten Handelspartnern der Briten am Hudson River auf und bekriegten fortan die s&#252;dlichen Verb&#252;ndeten der Wyandot, die Susquehannock. Langsam wurden die Susquehannock durch die Attacken der Mohawk und Oneida immer mehr aufgerieben und geschw&#228;cht. Die Huronen ihrerseits lie&#223;en sich, nachdem die Engl&#228;nder 1629 Quebec erobert hatten (bis 1632) durch Jean Nicolet f&#252;r einen Boykott der Engl&#228;nder gewinnen.</German>

[PARAGRAPH:1] Als ein &#252;berzeugender Sprecher und gewiefter Stratege f&#252;hrt er die pro-franz&#246;sischen Petun und Huronen gegen ihre erbitterten Rivalen die Iroquesen. Stets in Sorge, dass die Iroquesen letztlich die vollst&#228;ndige Ausl&#246;schung seines Stammes wieder vorantreiben k&#246;nnten, nutzte Kondiaronk eine Kombination aus &#252;berredung und Gewalt um die St&#228;mme der Oberen Seen zu vereinen um damit zu verhindern, dass diese eigene Friedensabkommen mit den Iroquesen schliessen w&#252;rden. [PARAGRAPH:1] Mit dem Ziel einen separaten Frieden zwischen Franzosen und Iroquesen zu verhindern, &#252;berfiel er 1688 iroquesische Abgesandte auf einer Strecke in der N&#228;he des heutigen Oswego und zog sich damit den Unmut des Gouvernuer Generals von Neu Frankreich zu. Neun Jahre sp&#228;ter in 1697 f&#252;hrte er einen Kriegstrupp, der 55 Seneca in einem zweist&#252;ndigen Kampf mit Canoes auf dem Lake Eire t&#246;tete und damit die Versuche der Seneca beendete sich mit &#252;bergelaufenen Huronen zu verb&#252;nden, was zum Bruch der Solidarit&#228;t der pro-franz&#246;sichen St&#228;mme f&#252;hrte. [PARAGRAPH:1] Eine allgmeine Schw&#228;chung der Iroquesen durch sowohl Krankheiten, wie auch Kriege aber auch die Unf&#228;higkeit der Engl&#228;nder, die n&#246;rdlichen und westlichen Grenzen der Iroquesen zu sch&#252;tzen, zwang die Iroquesen dazu ersthafterer Anstrengungen f&#252;r den frieden mit benachbarten Ureinwohnerst&#228;mmen und den Franzosen zu betreiben. Kondiaronk half darauf im Jahr 1701 dabei den Grossen Frieden von Montreal zu schmieden, welcher den Frieden f&#252;r Frankreich und dessen alliierten St&#228;mme mit der Iroquesen F&#246;deration sicherte. Dies beendete den sogenannten Bieber Krieg und &#246;ffnete das Inland des Kontinents f&#252;r weitere Erkundung und Handel f&#252;r die Franzosen. [PARAGRAPH:1] Kondiaronk lebte nicht lange genug um die Ergebnisse seiner Arbeit zu sehen, da er noch w&#228;hrend der Verhandlungen f&#252;r den Grossen Frieden in Montreal an Fieber starb.</German>

		<German>[TAB]Die Zapotec, das Wolkenvolk, entstanden w&#228;hrend des 6ten Jahrhunderts vor Christus im Oaxcatal. Die Zapotec kannten die komplexe Mathematike der Mayan und gelten als das erste Volk Mittelamerikas, dass eine Schrift entwickelte. Als ihre Hauptstadt Monte Alban zur gr&#246;ssten Stadt in den s&#252;dlichen Hochlanden des heutigen Mexikos anwuchs, begannen sie damit weit &#252;ber das Oaxaca-Tal hinaus zu kolonisieren und zu erobern. Um 900 nach Christus verliessen sie Monte Alban und verlegten ihr religi&#246;ses Zentrum nach Mitla, nur um wenig sp&#228;ter auch diese Stadt aufzugeben. W&#228;hrend der n&#228;chsten 3 Jahrhunderte schrumpfte das Imperium der Zapotec stetig, da mehr und mehr von ihrem Land von den Mixtec &#252;bernommen wurde. Gezwungen sich entweder der Herrschaft der Mixtec zu unterwerfen oder das Oaxaca-Tal zu verlassen, flohen die Zapotec in das Territorium ihrere Nachbarn und eroberten die Stadt Tehuantepec von den Zoquean und Huavean und machten diese zu ihrer neuen Hauptstadt.[PARAGRAPH:1] Im 15. Jahrhundert beendeten die Zapotec und die Mixtec ihre Feindschaft aufgrund einer neuen aufsteigenden Grossmacht, den Azteken. Um 1486 bis 1496, herrschte ein blutiger Krieg zwischen der Zapotec-Mixtec Allianz und den Azteken. Zwar zerst&#246;rten die Azteken Mitla und Zaachila-Yoo, die Hauptst&#228;dte der Zapotec, wurden jedoch letztlich von einer gemischten Zapotec-Mixtec Streitmacht unter der Befehlsgewalt des brillanten Strategen Cocijoeza wieder aus der Gegend vertrieben. Durch einen Friedensvertrage mit den Azteken und den Mixtec gelang es den Zapotec f&#252;r die folgenden 25 Jahre autonom zu bleiben.[PARAGRAPH:1] 1519 brach die Feindschaft zwischen Zapotec und Mixtec erneut aus, wurde aber durch die Ankunft der Spanier unterbrochen. Nach dem Fall des Azteken-Imperiums schworen die Zapotec Cortez die Gefolgschaft und halfen bei der Vernichtung der Mixtec. Die Zapotec wiederum wurden in einigen kurzen Campagnen der Spanier zwischen 1522 und 1527 ebenfalls von den Spaniern unterworfen.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Europeans first made contact with the Guarani in 1537, when the Spanish founded the city of Asuncion, later the capital of Paraguay. The first governor initiated the policy of intermarriage between Europeans and the indigenous women, and the enslavement of the native tribes who received no protection until the arrival of the Jesuits in 1585.  Further Jesuits soon followed, resulting in a Jesuit college being founded at Asuncion. As a consequence of Jesuit protests against the enslavement of the Guarani and other indigenous people, in 1608, King Philip III of Spain gave authority to the Jesuits to convert and colonize the tribes of Guayra.[PARAGRAPH:1] The first Guayra mission, Loreto, was established in 1610, and twelve more missions quickly followed, containing some 40,000 Guarani's who fled to the missions to escape enslavement. However, slave raiders saw the missions as little more than places to capture large quantities of slaves. In 1629 an army of Paulistas (Portuguese from Sao Paulo) attacked several missions, and within two years all but a few of the missions had been destroyed with 60,000 Guarani sent to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to be sold into slavery. By 1638, despite continued resistance, all twelve of the Jesuit missions beyond the Uruguay were abandoned, prompting Pope Urban VIII to forbid the enslavement of the missionaries, and King Philip IV of Spain to permit the Guarani to bear arms. The Paulista's attacked the missions again in 1641 and 1651, where they encountered fierce opposition from armed Guarani forces often led by Jesuits.[PARAGRAPH:1] In 1750, the Treaty of Madrid, between Spain and Portugal, transferred the territory occupied by the seven missions on the Uruguay from Spain to Portugal. The Guarani's were ordered to be removed, but refused. Seven years of guerilla warfare followed, known as the Guarani War, that left thousands of Guarani dead or enslaved, and a joint Spanish-Portuguese force occupying all seven missions. The Treaty of El Pardo, signed in 1761, reversed the terms of the Treaty of Madrid and restored the disputed mission territory back to Spanish jurisdiction. However, the Jesuits had little time to celebrate and in 1767, they were expelled from Spanish dominions by royal edict, submitting without resistance.[PARAGRAPH:1] The Guarani people and culture continue to exist.

Als Konsequenz auf die Proteste der Jesuiten gegen die Versklavung der Guarani und anderer St&#228;mme, gab 1608 K&#246;nig Philipp III von Spanien den Jesuiten die Authorit&#228;t die St&#228;mme von Guayra zu konvertieren und zu kolonisieren.[PARAGRAPH:1] 1610 wurde die erste Mission in Guayra errichtet, Loreto. Es folgten 12 weitere Missionen, die bald &#252;ber 40.000 Guarani umfassten, die dorthin vor der Versklavung fl&#252;chteten. Jedoch sahen die Sklavenf&#228;nger in den Missionen wenig mehr als geeignete Orte um grosse Mengen an Sklaven zu finden und zu fangen. 1629 griff eine grosse Armee Portugiesen aus Sao Paulo mehrere Missionen an und in weniger als zwei Jahren waren fast alle zerst&#246;rt und &#252;ber 60.000 Guarani nach Rio de Janeiro und Sao Paulo in die Sklaverei verkauft.  Trozt stetigem Widerstand waren um 1638 alle zw&#246;lf Misisonen, was dazu f&#252;hrte, dass der Papst die Versklavung von Missionaren verbot und K&#246;nig Philipp es den Guarani erlaubte Waffen zu tragen. Die Portugiesen griffen 1641 und 1651 die Missionen erneut an, trafen jedoch auf starken Widerstand durch bewaffnete Guarani, die oft von Jesuiten angef&#252;hrt wurden.[PARAGRAPH:1] 1750 &#252;bertrug der Vertrag von Madrid das Territorium von Uruguay von Spanien and Portugal. Den Guarani wurde befohlen das Gebiet zu verlassen, doch sie weigerten sich. Sieben jahre Guerilliakrieg folgten, die heutzutage als Guarani-Krieg bekannst sind, tausende tote und versklavte Guarani zur Folge hatten und die Spanier und Portugiesen dazu brachte mit einer gemeinsamen Streitmacht das Gebiet der Missionen zu besetzen. Der Vertag von El Pardo von 1761 kehrte den Vertrag von Madrid wieder um und unterwarf das Territorium der Missionen wieder spanischer Rechtssprechung. Dennoch hatten die Jesuiten wenig Zeit zum feiern, denn 1767 wurden sie durch k&#246;nigliches Edikt aller Spanischer Gebiete verwiesen. [PARAGRAPH:1] Das Volk der Guarani und ihre Kultur existieren noch heute. Die Mehrheit der Waldst&#228;mme an der Grenze des heutigen Paraguay sind Guarani und Nachkommen der Vertriebenen der Missionen. In einigen Provinzen Paraguays wird noch heute Guarani gesprochen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Europeans first made contact with the Guarani in 1537, when the Spanish founded the city of Asuncion, later the capital of Paraguay. The first governor initiated the policy of intermarriage between Europeans and the indigenous women, and the enslavement of the native tribes who received no protection until the arrival of the Jesuits in 1585.  Further Jesuits soon followed, resulting in a Jesuit college being founded at Asuncion. As a consequence of Jesuit protests against the enslavement of the Guarani and other indigenous people, in 1608, King Philip III of Spain gave authority to the Jesuits to convert and colonize the tribes of Guayra.[PARAGRAPH:1] The first Guayra mission, Loreto, was established in 1610, and twelve more missions quickly followed, containing some 40,000 Guarani's who fled to the missions to escape enslavement. However, slave raiders saw the missions as little more than places to capture large quantities of slaves. In 1629 an army of Paulistas (Portuguese from Sao Paulo) attacked several missions, and within two years all but a few of the missions had been destroyed with 60,000 Guarani sent to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to be sold into slavery. By 1638, despite continued resistance, all twelve of the Jesuit missions beyond the Uruguay were abandoned, prompting Pope Urban VIII to forbid the enslavement of the missionaries, and King Philip IV of Spain to permit the Guarani to bear arms. The Paulista's attacked the missions again in 1641 and 1651, where they encountered fierce opposition from armed Guarani forces often led by Jesuits.[PARAGRAPH:1] In 1750, the Treaty of Madrid, between Spain and Portugal, transferred the territory occupied by the seven missions on the Uruguay from Spain to Portugal. The Guarani's were ordered to be removed, but refused. Seven years of guerilla warfare followed, known as the Guarani War, that left thousands of Guarani dead or enslaved, and a joint Spanish-Portuguese force occupying all seven missions. The Treaty of El Pardo, signed in 1761, reversed the terms of the Treaty of Madrid and restored the disputed mission territory back to Spanish jurisdiction. However, the Jesuits had little time to celebrate and in 1767, they were expelled from Spanish dominions by royal edict, submitting without resistance.[PARAGRAPH:1] The Guarani people and culture continue to exist. The majority of the forest tribes on the borders of present day Paraguay are Guarani, many being the descendants of mission exiles. In Paraguay, Guarani heritage is dominant in the population and the Guarani language continues to be spoken in most provinces.</Italian>

[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]W&#228;hrend der Herrschaft von Harald Blatland akzeptierten sie 965 nach Christus das Christentum und wurden zu einem K&#246;nigreich.

Erst im sp&#228;ten 14ten Jahrhundert unter der F&#252;hrung von Margaret I, begannen sich die D&#228;nemark wieder zu erholen, als sich die drei K&#246;nigreiche D&#228;nemark, Scheweden und Norwegen verbanden und 1397 die Kalmar Union entstand. Aufgrund wachsender Spannungen zwischen D&#228;nemark und Schweden, war die Kalmar Union aber bald nur noch ein rechtliches Konzept. Mehrere Kriege zwischen den beiden Nationen folgten und Schwede trat schliesslich der Kalmar Union aus, was 1521 zu deren Kollaps f&#252;hrte. D&#228;nemark behielt jedoch die politische Kontrolle &#252;ber Norwegen und die zwei K&#246;nigreiche, als D&#228;nemark-Norwegen bekannt, blieben unter einem K&#246;nig vereint, obwphl Norwegen zu einem gewissen Masse noch autonom war. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]&#252;ber weite Teile des 17ten Jahrhunderst wurde D&#228;nemark in Kriege mit Schweden verstrickt. Im 30j&#228;hrigen Krieg, 1618 bis 48 und im Zweite Nord Krieg 1655 bis 1660, musste D&#228;nemark mit ansehen, wie grosse Teile von Norwegen und der &#246;stlichen K&#252;ste von D&#228;nemark an den Rivalen fielen. Nach dem Dritten Nord Krieg 1700 bis 1721 war Schweden so geschw&#228;cht, dass es keien grosse Gefahr mehr darstellte, aber die d&#228;nischen Verb&#252;ndeten widersetzten sich deren Anspr&#252;che auf fr&#252;here territioriale Anspr&#252;che um zu verhindern, dass die Seewege vom Baltikum bis zum Atlantik unter die Kontrolle einer einzigen Nation fielen. Den Rest des 18ten Jahrhunderts verbrachte D&#228;nemark in Frieden, wodurch die Wirtschaft wuchs und viele d&#228;nische Handelsschiffe die Ozeane zwischen Europa, Indien und Amerika bereisten, um die d&#228;nsichen Kolonien Gr&#246;nland im Nordatlantik, Tranquebar in Indien und die Inseln St. Thomas, St. John und St. Croix in the Caribbean zu besuchen.

		<Italian>From the 8th-11th centuries the Danes, were known as the Vikings. Widely renowned as fierce warriors, Viking parties raided and conquered parts of France and the British Isles, as well as establishing trades routes that extended from Greenland to Constantinople via Russian rivers. Excellent shipbuilders and navigators the Viking were the first Europeans to discover and settle Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Vineland and Newfoundland. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]With the reign of Harald Blatand, the Danes accepted Christianity in 965 AD, and were forged into one kingdom. By the 13th century, civil wars and ineffective leadership had weakened Denmark, with much of the country pawned off to the nobility. It was not until the late 14th century that Denmark under the rule of Margaret I,  began to recover as the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden became linked in 1397, in what became known as the Kalmar Union. Yet growing tensions between the Sweden and Denmark, swiftly reduced the union to a mere legal concept. Several wars between the two nations followed and Sweden eventually left the Kalmar Union forcing its collapse in 1521. Denmark still retained political control over Norway, and the two kingdoms known as Denmark-Norway, continued to be joined under a single monarch, although Norway maintained some degree of autonomy. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]For much of the 17th century, Denmark found itself embroiled in a series of wars against  Sweden. The Thirty Years War, 1618-48, and the Second Northern War, 1655-60, saw Denmark cede several large Norwegian territories and the whole of eastern Denmark to its bitter rival.  With the Third Northern War, 1700-21, Sweden was weakened to the point where it was no longer a threat, but Denmark's allies opposed Danish claims to former territorial possessions, fearing the waterway from the Baltic to the Atlantic being controlled by a single nation again. The rest of the 18th century saw Denmark at peace, as its economy continued to expand and Danish merchant ships traded across Europe, to India and the America's, traveling to the Danish colonies of Greenland in the North Atlantic, Tranquebar in India, and the islands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix in the Caribbean. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]With the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, the Danish navy was defeated by the British Navy in 1801, and forced to surrender their entire fleet to the British in 1807.  By 1813 Denmark had been bankrupted by the war and sued for peace, witnessing in the following year, the dissolution of its union with Norway, which was granted to Sweden at the Treaty of Kiel. Yet, despite its losses the period was also one of a "golden age", for Danish intellectual history, Literature, painting, sculpture and philosophy which all experienced a vibrant rebirth.</Italian>

Munk lived in Bahia (today's Salvador) for six years, where he was in the service of Duart Duez' brother, Miguel.

In 1614 he lead a search for the notoriuos Spanish privateer Jan Mendoza, who he fought in a battle at Kanin Nos near the entrance of the White Sea. In the spring of 1617 he recruited eighteen Basque whalemen for the first Danish whaling expedition to Spitsbergen. In 1618 king Christian IV appointed him as commander of the first Danish expedition to East India with five vessels and almost 1000 men, but only one month before the departure of the expedition in November Munk was relegated and replaced by the much younger nobleman Ove Gjedde. The reason for the relegation is unclear, but was most likely caused by a conflict Munk had with the Lord Chancellor, Christian Friis. A few months earlier Munk also had lost a vast amount of money as a result of an unsuccessful whaling expedition and which caused loss of social prestige. As an attempt to regain his social position he started the planning of a much more spectacular expedition in 1619, the search for the Northwest Passage.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]On 9 May 1619, under the auspices of King Christian IV, Munk set out with 65 men and His Royal Majesty's two ships, the Unicorn and Lamprey, to discover the Northwest Passage to the Indies and China.

In September 1619 he found the entrance to Hudson Bay and spent the winter near the mouth of the Churchill River. Cold, famine, and scurvy destroyed so many of his men that only two persons besides himself survived.

Munk died on 26 June the same year probably as a result of being wounded in the battles in the Kieler fjord a couple of months earlier.

		<German>[H1]Jens Munk[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Entdecker Navigator[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD] 1579 - 1628 [PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Jens Munk war ein norwegischer Navigatur und Entdecker. Geboren in Arendal im S&#252;den Norwegens, wo sein Vater, der Edelmann Erik Munk, Gouverneur war. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Im Jahre 1591, im Alter von zw&#246;lf, ging Munk nach Oporto in Portugal wo er f&#252;r den Schiffsmagnaten Duart Duez arbeitete. Die folgenden Jahre segelte er mit einem niederl&#228;ndischen Konvoi nach Bahia in Brasilien. An der brasilianischen K&#252;ste wurde der Konvoy von franz&#246;sischen Piraten angegriffen. Munk war einer von nur sieben &#252;berlebenden. Munk lebte daraufhin in Bahia (heute Salvador) f&#252;r sechs Jahre im Dienste von Duart Duezes Bruder. Unter dramatischen Umst&#228;nden kehrte Munk im Jahre 1599 nach Copenhange zur&#252;ck und wurden vom Lordkanler Henrik Ramel als Schiffsjunge angeworben.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Nach zwei erfolglosen Versuchen die Nordostpassage zu finden, fand er die Aufmerksamkeit von K&#246;nig Christian IV. Im Schwedisch-D&#228;nischen Krieg (1611-1613), dem sogenannten Kalmar Krieg, f&#252;hrte Jens Munk 1612 zusammen mit dem Edelmann Jorgen Daa erfolgreich einen Angriff auf die schwedische Festung Alvsborg, nahe G&#246;teburg. 1614 f&#252;hrte er die Suche nach dem ber&#252;chtigten Spanischen Freibeuter Jan Mendoza, den er letzlich in der White Sea in der Schlacht von Kanis Nos stellte. Im Fr&#252;hjahr 1617 rekrutierte er achtzehn baskische Walf&#228;nger f&#252;r die erste d&#228;nische Walfangexpedition nach Spitzbergen. 1618 ernannten K&#246;nig Christian IV ihn als Kommandanten der ersten d&#228;nischen Expedition nach Ostindien, die 5 Schiffen und fast 1000 Mann umfasste. Jedoch nur einen Monat vor der Abfahrt der Expedition wurde Munk durch einen viel j&#252;ngeren Edelmann ersetzt, Ove Gjedde. Der Grund hierf&#252;r war vermutlich ein Konflikt zwischen Munk und dem Lordkanzler Christian Friis. Einige Monate davor hatte Munk auch viel Geld und Prestige in einem erfolglosen Walfangunternehmen verloren. Als Versuch seinen sozialen Stand wiederzuerlangen plante Munk 1619 eine spektakul&#228;re Expedition zur Suche der Nordwestpassage.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Im Mai 1619, mit dem Segen von K&#246;nig Christian IV, setzte Munk mit 65 M&#228;nnern und zwei Schiffen, Unicorn und Lamprey, segel um die Nordwestpassage nach Indien und China zu entdecken. Im September 1619 fand er die Hudson Bay und verbrachte den Winter an der M&#252;ndung des Churchill River. K&#228;lte, Hunger und Krankheiten t&#246;tete so viele seiner M&#228;nner, das ausser Munk zur noch zwei weitere &#252;berlebten. Mit diesen beiden M&#228;nnern gelang es ihm die Lamprey" zwischen dem 16. Juli 1620 und dem 20. September 1620 zur&#252;ck nach Bergen in Norwegen zu segeln.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Munk plante eine weitere Nordwestpassagenreise um f&#252;r die d&#228;nsiche Krone Besitz von "Nova Dania" (Neu-D&#228;nemark), jedoch lies seine schwache Gesundheit dies nicht zu. In den folgenden Jahren dient Munk als Kapit&#228;n in der k&#246;niglichen Flotte. Im 30-j&#228;hrigen Krieg befehligte Munk eine Blockade der Weser zwischen 1626 und 1627 und war an einem Angriff Wallensteins im Kieler Fjord 1628 beteiligt. Munk starb am 26. Juni des selben Jahres, was vermutlich auf eine Verwundung w&#228;hrend der Schlacht im Kielder Fjord, einige Monate zuvor, zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist.</German>

		<English>[H1]Hans Poulsen Egede[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lutheran missionary, Greenland colonizer[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1686 - 1758 [PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Hans Poulsen Egede was a Norwegian Lutheran missionary, called the Apostle of Greenland. Egede was an evangelist on the northern Norwegian islands of Lofoten when he heard stories about the Viking settlements in Greenland, with which contact had been lost years before. In May 1721, he asked Frederick IV of Denmark for permission to seek the colony and establish a mission there, presuming that it had remained Catholic or lost the Christian faith. Frederick gave consent at least partially to reestablish a colonial claim to the island.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede landed on the west coast of Greenland on July 3. He was sent to seek the old Viking colony on Greenland but he found no survivors. The last communication with that colony had been over 300 years earlier. He did, however, find the Inuit and started a mission among them. He studied the Inuit language and translated Christian texts into it. This required some imagination as, for instance, the Inuit had no bread nor any idea of it. So the words of the Lord's Prayer were translated by Egede as the equivalent of "Give us this day our daily harbor seal".[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede founded Godtheb (now Nuuk), which later became the capital of Greenland. In 1724, he baptised the first children. The new king, Christian VI of Denmark, recalled all Europeans from Greenland in 1730. Egede remained, however, encouraged by his wife Gertrud. Egede's book Det gamle Grnlands nye Perlustration, (The old Greenland's new Perlustration, or an accurate description of those old Nordic Colonies in Greenland) appeared in 1729 and was translated into several languages.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]In 1733, the Herrnhut missionaries of Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf were allowed to establish New Herrnhut, south of Nuuk. In 1734, a smallpox epidemic broke out which spread through the Inuit and claimed Gertrud Egede in 1735. Hans Egede left his son Paul in Greenland and traveled on 9 August 1736 with his daughters and his son Niels to Copenhagen. In 1741, he was named bishop of Greenland. He established a catechism for use in Greenland in 1747.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede became a national saint of Greenland and the town of Egedesminde (literally: memory of Egede) commemorates him. It was established by Niels Egede, Hans' second and surviving son, in 1759 on the Eqalussuit peninsula but moved to the island of Aasiaat in 1763, which had been the site of a pre-Viking Inuit settlement.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Hans Egede gives one of the oldest desciptions of a sea serpent. On 6 July 1734 his ship sailed past the coast of Greenland when suddenly those on board "saw a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the crow's nest on the mainmast. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship", wrote Egede.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]A hulk named after Hans Egede can be found at the point where Cliffe marshes meet the Thames, adjacent to Cliffe Fort.</English>

He did, however, find the Inuit and started a mission among them. He studied the Inuit language and translated Christian texts into it. This required some imagination as, for instance, the Inuit had no bread nor any idea of it. So the words of the Lord's Prayer were translated by Egede as the equivalent of "Give us this day our daily harbor seal".[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede founded Godthb (now Nuuk), which later became the capital of Greenland. In 1724, he baptised the first children. The new king, Christian VI of Denmark, recalled all Europeans from Greenland in 1730. Egede remained, however, encouraged by his wife Gertrud. Egede's book Det gamle Grnlands nye Perlustration, (The old Greenland's new Perlustration, or an accurate description of those old Nordic Colonies in Greenland) appeared in 1729 and was translated into several languages.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]In 1733, the Herrnhut missionaries of Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf were allowed to establish New Herrnhut, south of Nuuk. In 1734, a smallpox epidemic broke out which spread through the Inuit and claimed Gertrud Egede in 1735. Hans Egede left his son Paul in Greenland and traveled on 9 August 1736 with his daughters and his son Niels to Copenhagen. In 1741, he was named bishop of Greenland. He established a catechism for use in Greenland in 1747.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede became a national saint of Greenland and the town of Egedesminde (literally: memory of Egede) commemorates him. It was established by Niels Egede, Hans' second and surviving son, in 1759 on the Eqalussuit peninsula but moved to the island of Aasiaat in 1763, which had been the site of a pre-Viking Inuit settlement.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Hans Egede gives one of the oldest desciptions of a sea serpent. On 6 July 1734 his ship sailed past the coast of Greenland when suddenly those on board "saw a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the crow's nest on the mainmast. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship", wrote Egede.

In Mai 1721, fragte er Frederick IV von D&#228;nemark um Erlaubnis um diese Kolonien zu suchen und dort eine Mission zu errichten. Frederick gab seine Einwilligung um dort koloniale Anspr&#252;che zu erheben.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede landete an der Westk&#252;ste von Gr&#246;nland am 3.

Er studierte die Sprache der Inuit und &#252;bersetzte christliche Texte in diese. Dies bedurfte viel Vorstellungskraft, da die Inuit beispielsweise kein Brot kannte oder eine Vorstellung davon hatten. So wurden viele Gebete in idiome &#252;bersetzt, die die Inuit auch verstanden.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede gr&#252;ndetet Gothab (heutzutage Nuuk), welches sp&#228;ter die Hauptstad von Gr&#246;nland wurde. 1724 taufte er die ersten Kinder.

[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Egede wurde zum nationalen Heiligen von Gr&#246;nland und die Stadt Egedesminde (sprichw&#246;rtlich: Erinnerung an Egede) erinnert noch heute an ihn.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Soon after the recession of the last ice age, Sweden became populated by hunters and gatherers, during the Stone Age (6000 BC - 4000 BC). The region developed rather slowly compared to southern Europe; while the Romans wrote poetry, Scandinavia had just entered the Iron Age.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sweden was first mentioned in the 1st century, by Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote that the Suiones tribe lived out in the sea and were powerful in both arms and ships. This referred to the inhabitants of eastern Sweden: Svealand, primarily around lake M&#228;laren; towns of Stockholm, Sigtuna, and Birka. From this tribe, Sweden derived its name. The southern parts, on the other hand, were inhabited by Geats (G&#246;tar) in the G&#246;taland territory. Little is known for certain about that time, but chronicles based on Norse sagas and the Beowulf epos go back about 2,000 years.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Viking Age of the 9th and 10th century, Swedish vikings travelled east setting its mark on the Baltic countries, Russia, the Black Sea, further through the rivers of Russia down south to Constantinople and southern Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]With Christianization in the 12th century, the country became consolidated, with its centre in the water-ways of the northern Baltic and the Gulf of Finland. In the 14th century Sweden, like the rest of Europe, was struck by the Black Death (the Plague), with all its effect.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the middle ages, the expansion of Sweden into the northern wilderness of Laplandia, the Scandinavian peninsula, and present-day Finland continued. Finland was a part of Sweden proper from 1362 until 1809.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1389, Norway, Denmark and Sweden were united under a single monarch in a treaty known as the Kalmar Union. After several wars and disputes between these nations, King Gustav I of Sweden (House of Vasa) broke free in 1521 and established a nation state, considered the foundation of modern Sweden. Shortly afterwards he rejected Catholicism and led Sweden to the Protestant Reformation. Gustav I is considered to be Sweden's "Father of the Nation". He was the first monarch from the House of Vasa. The House of Vasa also ruled between 1587 and 1668 in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Between 1592 and 1599 Sweden and Poland were ruled in a personal union by Sigismund I Vasa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rise of Sweden as a Great Power, Swedish Empire, Sweden and the Great Northern War, Absolute Monarchy in Sweden, Sweden-Finland and Union between Sweden and Norway.[PARAGRAPH:1]The 17th century saw the rise of Sweden as one of the great powers in Europe, due to successful participation, initiated by King Gustav II Adolph, in the Thirty Years' War and by Charles X Gustav of Sweden in the The Deluge of Poland. Mighty as it was, it crumbled in the 18th century with Imperial Russia taking the reins of northern Europe in the Great Northern War, and finally in 1809 when the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was created out of the eastern half of Sweden.[PARAGRAPH:1]After Denmark was defeated in the Napoleonic wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Kiel. This led to the Campaign against Norway, which was fought in 1814, and ended with the Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a union with Sweden that was not dissolved until 1905. But the campaign also signified the last of the Swedish wars and its 200 years of peace are arguably unique in the world today.[PARAGRAPH:1]The 19th century saw a significant population increase, generally attributed to peace, vaccination, and potatoes, doubling the population from 1750 to 1850. Many people in the countryside, where most Swedes lived, found themselves unemployed. The result was poverty, alcoholism, and massive emigration; it is believed that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States alone. In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Sweden's second biggest city, Gothenburg. However, as the Industrial revolution progressed during the century, people gradually began moving into cities to work in factories, and became involved in Socialistic unions. A threatening Socialist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of Parliamentarism, and the country was democratized.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sweden remained neutral during World War I and World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed. Sweden was part of the Marshall aid package but continued to stay non-aligned during the Cold War, and is still not a member of any military alliance. Following the second World War, Sweden made use of its natural resources and undemolished state, making it possible to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe, leading it to be one of the richest countries in the world by 1960. During most of the post-war era, the country was ruled by the Swedish Social Democratic Party that established a welfare state, striving for a "well being for all"-policy.[PARAGRAPH:1]As other economies were re-established, Sweden was surpassed in the 1970s, and had to adjust its politics in the 1990s, but still ranks among the top nations concerning well being of its inhabitants.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Bald nach dem R&#252;ckgang der letzten Eiszeit wurde Schweden in der Steinzeit durch J&#228;ger und Sammler bev&#246;lkert. (6000 BC - 4000 BC). Die Region entwickelte sich im Vergleich zu S&#252;deuropa sehr langsam. W&#228;hrend die R&#246;mer bereits Gediche schrieben und eine ausgepr&#228;gte Kultur aufwiesen, hatte Skandinavien gerad erst die Eisenzeit erreicht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Schweden wird zum ersten Mal im 1ten Jahrhunder schriftlich erw&#228;hnt. Der r&#246;mische Historiker Tacitus schrieb, dass der Stamm der Suionen im offenen Meer beheimatet sei und sowohl erfahrene Seefahere, wie auch m&#228;chtige Krieger seien. Dies bezog sich auf die Einwohner des &#246;stlichen Schwedens, Svealand, in der N&#228;he der heutigen St&#228;dte Stockholm und Birka. Durch diesen Stamm bekam Schweden seinen Namen. Die s&#252;dlichen Teile wurden von den Geaten beheimatet. Wenig ist &#252;ber diese V&#246;lker sicher bekannt, aber einige Chroniken und Sagen, wie das Beowulf Epos, reichen fast 2000 Jahre bis ins 1te Jahrhundert zur&#252;ck.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Wikingerzeitalter des 9ten und 10ten Jahrhunderts, bereisten Schwedische Wikinger ostw&#228;rts in die baltischen Gebiete und hinterliesen dort, in Russland und in der Gegend des Scharzen Meeres ihre Spuren. Sie reisten sogar &#252;ber die Fl&#252;sse Russlands bis nach Konstantinopel und nach S&#252;deuropa. [PARAGRAPH:1]Mit der Christianisierung im 12ten Jahrhundert wurde das Land konsolidiert. Das Zentrum waren die Wasserstrassen im Baltikum und im Golf von Finnland. Im 14ten Jahrhundert wurde Schweden, wie der Rest Europas auch, von der Pest heimgesucht. [PARAGRAPH:1]Im Mittelalter schritt die Expansion Schwedens nach Lapland, die Skandinavische Peninsula und das heuteige Finnland weiter fort. Zwischen 1362 und 1809 war Finnland Teil Schwedens. [PARAGRAPH:1]1389, wurden Norwegen, D&#228;nemark und Schweden unter einem einzigen Monarchen in der Kalmar Union vereint. Nach mehreren Konflikten und sogar Kriegen zwischen diesen drei M&#228;chten brach King Gustav I von Schweden jedoch das Abkommen 1521 und etablierte einen Nationalstaat, der heute als Ursprung des modernen Schwedens betrachtet wird. Kurz danach sagte er sich vom Katholizismus los und f&#252;hrte Schweden in die Protestantische Reformation. Zwischen 1592 und 1599 wurden Schweden und Polen in einer Personalunion durch Sigismund I Vasa regiert.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das 17te Jahrhunder sah Schwede zu einer Grossmacht in Europa aufsteigen, die im 30-j&#228;hrigen Krieg eine wichtige Rolle spielte. So m&#228;chtig Schweden auch war, zerbrach es schliesslich daran, dass Russland die Vormachtstellung in Nordosteuropa &#252;bernahm und Finnland sich 1809 losl&#246;ste. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem D&#228;nemark im Napoleonischen Krieg besiegt war, wurde Norwegen im Vertrag von Kiel Schweden zugesprochen. Dies f&#252;hrte zu einer Kampagne gegen Norwegen, die 1814 heftige K&#228;mpfe verursachte und mit der Konvention von Moss beendet wurde, die Norwegen schliesslich in eine Union mit Schweden zwang, die erst 1905 wieder aufgel&#246;st wurde. Diese Kampagne war jedoch der letzte signifikante Konflikt Schwedens und die 200 Jahre Frieden, die das Land seitdem erlebt, sind zweifellos einzigartig auf der Welt.</German>

[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Rislinghs erste Amtshandlung als Gouverneur von Neu Schweden bestand daraus, die wachsenden Bedrohung einer Umschliessung durch die Niederlande zu neutralisieieren indem er den niederl&#228;ndischen Aussenposten Fort Casimier einnahm, der etwas s&#252;dlich der schwedischen Siedlung Fort Christina errichtet worden war. Die Niederlande reagierten mit einer milit&#228;rische Kampagne, die nicht nur das Fort wieder einnahm, sondern auch schritteweise zur Kapitulation einer jeden einzelnen schwedischen Siedlung f&#252;hrte, wodurch die kurze Geschichte von Neu-Schweden beendet wurde.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB]Nach der Unterwerfung wurden die Siedler, die nicht niederl&#228;ndische Untertanen werden wollten, zur&#252;ck nach Europa verschifft.

		<English>[TAB]Indo-European, Ural-Altaic, and other races have occupied what is now the territory of Russia since 2000 BC, but little is known about their institutions and activities. Modern Russia dates from about 770 AD, when Viking explorers began an intensive penetration of the Volga region. From bases in estuaries along the eastern Baltic, Scandinavian bands, probably in search of new trade routes to the east, began to penetrate territory populated by Finnish and Slavic tribes, where they found unlimited natural resources. [PARAGRAPH:2]Within a few decades the Rus, as the Viking settlers were known, together with other Scandinavians operating farther west, extended their raiding activities down the main river routes toward Baghdad and Constantinople, reaching the Black Sea in 860. In the period from 930 to 1000, the region came under complete control by the Rus from their capital at Kiev. The lifeblood of this sprawling Kievan empire was the commerce organized by these Viking princes. Sometime around 1000 the Kievan princes were converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries, and the medieval Russian states would maintain close cultural ties with the Byzantines. The united Kievan state broke apart after 1054 under the pressure of attacks by nomads from the steppes, fragmenting Russia into a number of independent principalities. The devastating attack by the Mongols in 1237-40 resulted in widepread destruction of cities, loss of life, and wiped out a developing commercial middle class centered around the fur trade. This helped bring about the long rule of autocracy in Russia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Of the various Russian principalities, it was Muscovy that proved to be the most successful. Beginning as the state that collected taxes for Russia's Mongol overlords, the princes of Muscovy eventually gained a position of leadership by throwing off the yoke of their oppressors. Ivan III (1462-1505) consolidated the gains his father, Vasily II, had won in the saddle, and his warrior descendent Ivan IV (1533-84), known as Ivan the Terrible, gained enough power to take the title of "Tsar", or Emperor, in 1547. This "gathering of the Russian lands" became a conscious and irresistible five-century drive by Moscow to annex all Slavic lands, both the Russian territories and the Belorussian and Ukrainian regions. The ascension of Peter I (1694-1725), known as Peter the Great, ushered in and established the social, political, and intellectual trends that were to dominate Russia for the next two centuries. The location of his new capital, St. Petersburg, on the shores of the Gulf of Finland symbolized this shift toward a European involvement. But while the Russian aristocracy may have adopted the courtly behavior and modern military tactics of the West, the vast majority of the Russian people remained mired in a slave-like state of feudal servitude.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine the Great (1762-1796), though a German princess who was unrelated to Peter in any way, would prove to be his true intellectual and political heir. Catherine's reign was notable for imperial expansion. Most important were the securing of the northern shore of the Black Sea, the annexation of the Crimea, and the expansion into the steppes beyond the Urals. This permitted the protection of Russian agricultural settlements in the south and the establishment of trade routes through the Black Sea. In the process, the military democracies of the Cossack hosts along the Dnieper, Don, and Volga rivers lost their autonomy and special privileges; the wealthier officers became Russian nobles, receiving the right to own and settle serfs on their own lands, while the fierce horsemen sank to the level of peasants with special military obligations. Catherine's partitioning of Poland also helped bring Russia closer to the rest of Europe, at least geographically.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite the heritage of Peter and Catherine, by the time of Nicholas II (1894-1917) Russia was in disarray, plagued by internal misery and oppression. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War followed by the 1905 Revolution indicated that Russia was in need of drastic reforms, but the autocratic structure of the Tsarist state was poorly suited to adapt to changing conditions. World War I imposed stresses on the Tsardom that it could not meet, and the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917, riding on a wave of popular discontent. The Kerensky Provisional Government, a moderate attempt to resolve the problems, collapsed in the face of the Bolshevik (Communist) revolution. Given the Bolshevik desire to dominate the whole of Russia and the rest of the former Tsarist empire, civil war was inevitable, and a bitter struggle between Red (Communist) and White (Tsarist) forces lasted until the Bolsheviks were victorious in 1922. Stalin would complete the consolidation of Communist power begun by Lenin, most notably through the forced industrialization of the Five-Year Plans and the mass starvations engendered by the collectivization of agriculture. Despite an almost inhuman level of suffering imposed on the Russian people, Stalin would lead the Soviet Union through the greatest threat to its existence during the Nazi invasion of 1941-45, and help it emerge as one of the world's superpowers following the Second World War. [PARAGRAPH:2]But in the ensuing Cold War, Russia's economy tottered towards collapse. The Communist economic system worked well at producing millions of tons of iron for use in tanks, but was unable to produce simple household goods to improve the daily lives of its people. Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to revive the stagnant Soviet economy through the relaxation of economic and political controls, but the forces of free speech and a free market quickly took hold in a way Gorbachev never would have imagined. Within a few years, the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe were declaring their independence and new politicians like Boris Yeltsin were demanding democratic elections. An ill-conceived, ill-planned, and poorly executed coup attempt to unseat Yeltsin occurred in August 1991, bringing an end to the Communist Party and accelerating the movement to disband the Soviet Union. Yeltsin dissolved the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1991, banned the Communist Party in Russia, and seized all of its property, becoming the first president of Russia. Today, as it often has throughout its history, Russia finds itself struggling between whether to follow the example of the West or pursue its own unique path of development.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Depuis 2000 av. J.-C., des Indo-europ&#233;ens, des Ouralo-alta&#239;ques et d'autres races occupent ce qui constitue actuellement le territoire de la Russie, mais on ne sait que peu de choses sur leurs institutions et leurs activit&#233;s. La naissance de la Russie moderne remonte &#224; environ 770 ap. J.-C., lorsque les explorateurs vikings entreprennent de p&#233;n&#233;trer massivement dans la r&#233;gion de la Volga. A partir de bases situ&#233;es dans les estuaires du bord de la mer Baltique orientale, des groupes scandinaves, qui recherchent sans doute de nouvelles routes commerciales vers l'Est, commencent &#224; s'aventurer dans ce territoire peupl&#233; par des tribus finlandaises et slaves o&#249; ils trouvent des ressources naturelles illimit&#233;es. En l'espace de quelques d&#233;cennies, les Var&#232;gues, nom sous lequel sont connus les colons vikings, ainsi que d'autres Scandinaves actifs plus &#224; l'Ouest, &#233;tendent leurs attaques aux principales routes fluviales vers Bagdad et Constantinople, atteignant la Mer noire en 860. De 930 &#224; 1000, la r&#233;gion passe int&#233;gralement sous le contr&#244;le des Var&#232;gues, dont la capitale est Kiev. Le commerce organis&#233; par les princes vikings constitue la force vitale de cet immense empire de Kiev. Vers l'an 1000, les princes kieviens sont convertis au christianisme par des missionnaires byzantins. Les Etats russes m&#233;di&#233;vaux conserveront de forts liens culturels avec les Byzantins. L'unit&#233; de l'Etat de Kiev vole en &#233;clat apr&#232;s 1054 sous la pression des attaques de nomades des steppes, fragmentant la Russie en plusieurs principaut&#233;s ind&#233;pendantes. L'attaque d&#233;vastatrice des Mongols en 1237-1240 conduit &#224; la destruction massive des villes, fait de nombreux morts et entra&#238;ne la disparition de la classe moyenne qui se d&#233;veloppait en axant ses activit&#233;s sur le commerce de la fourrure. Cette situation contribue &#224; l'instauration du long r&#232;gne de l'autocratie en Russie.[PARAGRAPH:2]Parmi les diverses principaut&#233;s russes, celle de Moscou est la plus prosp&#232;re. Au d&#233;part, c'est elle qui per&#231;oit les taxes pour les seigneurs mongols de Russie mais les princes moscovites finissent par gagner une position &#233;minente en brisant le joug de leurs oppresseurs. Ivan III (1462-1505) consolide les annexions r&#233;alis&#233;es par son p&#232;re Vassili II et son fils guerrier Ivan IV (1533-84), connu comme Ivan le Terrible, gagne suffisamment de pouvoir pour prendre le titre de "tsar", ou empereur, en 1547. Cette "r&#233;unification des terres russes" devient pendant cinq si&#232;cles, pour Moscou, une course consciente et irr&#233;sistible destin&#233;e &#224; annexer toutes les terres slaves, qu'il s'agisse de territoires russes ou des r&#233;gions d'Ukraine et de Bi&#233;lorussie. L'arriv&#233;e au pouvoir de Pierre Ier (1694-1725), &#233;galement connu sous le nom de Pierre le Grand, permet d'introduire et de mettre en place les orientations sociales, politiques et intellectuelles qui vont dominer la Russie durant les deux si&#232;cles suivants. L'emplacement de la capitale, Saint-P&#233;tersbourg, sur les rivages du Golfe de Finlande symbolise la volont&#233; de rapprochement vers l'Europe. Si l'aristocratie russe adopte le comportement courtois et les tactiques militaires modernes de l'ouest, la grande majorit&#233; de la population russe reste dans un &#233;tat de quasi-esclavage et de servitude f&#233;odale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine II la Grande (1762-1796), m&#234;me si elle est une princesse allemande nullement apparent&#233;e &#224; Pierre le Grand, s'av&#232;re sa v&#233;ritable h&#233;riti&#232;re intellectuelle et politique. Son r&#232;gne sera marqu&#233; par des expansions imp&#233;riales. Les plus importantes consistent &#224; s&#233;curiser les rivages du nord de la mer Noire, &#224; annexer la Crim&#233;e et &#224; s'&#233;tendre dans les steppes au-del&#224; de l'Oural. Ainsi, la protection des implantations agricoles russes est assur&#233;e dans le sud et des routes commerciales passant par la mer Noire peuvent &#234;tre &#233;tablies. Au cours de ces campagnes, les d&#233;mocraties militaires des peuples cosaques vivant sur les bords du Dniepr, du Don et de la Volga perdent leur autonomie et leurs privil&#232;ges. Les officiers les plus riches deviennent des nobles russes, recevant le droit de d&#233;tenir et de recourir &#224; des serfs sur leurs propres terres tandis que les farouches cavaliers descendent au rang de paysans avec des obligations militaires sp&#233;ciales. La partition de la Pologne par Catherine II aide &#224; rapprocher la Russie du reste de l'Europe, au moins d'un point de vue g&#233;ographique.[PARAGRAPH:2]Malgr&#233; l'h&#233;ritage de Pierre le Grand et de Catherine II, &#224; l'&#233;poque de Nicolas II (1894-1917), la Russie sombre dans le chaos, menant une guerre on&#233;reuse alors qu'elle est en proie &#224; la mis&#232;re interne et &#224; l'oppression. La d&#233;faite lors de la guerre russo-japonaise, puis la r&#233;volution de 1905, montrent que la Russie a besoin de r&#233;formes radicales, mais la structure autocratique de l'Etat tsariste est peu adapt&#233;e aux &#233;volutions. La Premi&#232;re Guerre mondiale impose des efforts, impossibles pour le r&#233;gime tsariste, ce qui d&#233;clenche la r&#233;volution de 1917, qui surfe sur la vague du m&#233;contentement populaire. Le gouvernement provisoire de Kerenski, qui tente de fa&#231;on mod&#233;r&#233;e de r&#233;soudre les probl&#232;mes, ne r&#233;siste pas &#224; la r&#233;volution bolchevique (communiste). Compte tenu du d&#233;sir des Bolcheviques de dominer toute la Russie et le reste de l'ancien Empire tsariste, la guerre civile para&#238;t in&#233;vitable et une lutte f&#233;roce s'engage entre les forces rouges (communistes) et blanches (tsaristes) jusqu'&#224; la victoire des Bolcheviques en 1922. Staline ach&#232;ve la consolidation de la puissance communiste initi&#233;e par L&#233;nine, par le biais notamment de l'industrialisation forc&#233;e des plans quinquennaux et par la collectivisation de l'agriculture qui entra&#238;ne des famines massives. Le niveau de souffrance impos&#233; au peuple russe par Staline est pratiquement inhumain mais cela ne l'emp&#234;che pas de diriger l'Union sovi&#233;tique lorsque l'invasion nazie de 1941-1945 porte la plus grave atteinte &#224; l'existence de la nation. Staline contribue &#224; faire de son pays l'une des superpuissances mondiales apr&#232;s la Deuxi&#232;me Guerre mondiale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Lors de la p&#233;riode de guerre froide qui s'ensuit, l'&#233;conomie russe s'effondre. Le syst&#232;me &#233;conomique communiste parvient parfaitement &#224; produire des millions de tonnes de fer servant &#224; fabriquer des chars, mais il est incapable de produire de simples produits m&#233;nagers permettant d'am&#233;liorer la vie quotidienne de la population. Mikha&#239;l Gorbatchev tente de faire repartir l'&#233;conomie sovi&#233;tique en stagnation en rel&#226;chant les contr&#244;les politiques et &#233;conomiques, mais les forces de la libre expression et du march&#233; libre s'emballent et deviennent incontr&#244;lables. En quelques ann&#233;es, les Etats-satellites sovi&#233;tiques d'Europe de l'Est d&#233;clarent leur ind&#233;pendance et de nouveaux hommes politiques comme Boris Eltsine r&#233;clament des &#233;lections d&#233;mocratiques. Une tentative de coup d'Etat, mal planifi&#233;e et mal ex&#233;cut&#233;e, destin&#233;e &#224; faire perdre son poste &#224; Gorbatchev a lieu en ao&#251;t 1991, mettant fin au Parti communiste et acc&#233;l&#233;rant le mouvement de dissolution de l'Union sovi&#233;tique. En d&#233;cembre 1991, Eltsine dissout l'Union des r&#233;publiques socialistes sovi&#233;tiques, interdit le Parti communiste en Russie et saisit tous ses biens, devenant le premier pr&#233;sident de la Russie. Aujourd'hui, comme cela a souvent &#233;t&#233; le cas dans son histoire, la Russie se retrouve face &#224; un dilemme : suivre l'exemple de l'Ouest ou poursuivre sa voie unique de d&#233;veloppement.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Indo-europ&#228;ische, Ural-altaische und andere V&#246;lker besetzten 2000 v.Chr. das Gebiet des heutigen Russlands, allerdings ist nur wenig &#252;ber ihre damaligen Siedlungen und Aktivit&#228;ten bekannt. Das moderne Russland entstand um 770 n.Chr., als die Wikinger massiv in die Wolga-Region vorstie&#223;en. Von ihren Stellungen in den Meeresarmen entlang des &#246;stlichen Baltikums zogen skandinavische Horden - vermutlich auf der Suche nach neuen Handelswegen - in Richtung Osten und drangen in das von finnischen und slawischen St&#228;mmen bev&#246;lkerte Gebiet vor, wo sie schier unersch&#246;pfliche nat&#252;rliche Ressourcen vorfanden. [PARAGRAPH:2]Binnen weniger Jahrzehnte dehnten die Rus, wie die Siedler der Wikinger genannt wurden, ihre Beutez&#252;ge gemeinsam mit anderen Skandinaviern entlang der wichtigen Flussl&#228;ufe nach Westen in Richtung Bagdad und Konstantinopel aus und erreichten 860 das Schwarze Meer. Zwischen 930 und 1000 gelangte die Region vollst&#228;ndig unter die Kontrolle der Rus, deren Regierungssitz sich in der Hauptstadt Kiew befand. Das Fundament dieses wachsenden Kiewer Reiches bildete der von den Wikingerprinzen organisierte Handel. Seit der Christianisierung durch byzantinische Missionare (um 1000) waren Kiew und die russischen Staaten des Mittelalters eng mit der byzantinischen Kultur verbunden. Das vereinte Kiew zerbrach nach 1054 unter den Angriffen nomadischer Steppenv&#246;lker in mehrere unabh&#228;ngige F&#252;rstent&#252;mer. W&#228;hrend der Mongolenkriege (1237-40) wurden zahlreiche russische St&#228;dte zerst&#246;rt und unz&#228;hlige Mitglieder des aufstrebenden russischen Mittelstandes (vorwiegend Fellh&#228;ndler) ausgel&#246;scht. In der Folgezeit wurde Russland von mehreren autokratischen Regenten beherrscht.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Laufe der Jahre &#252;bernahm das kleine F&#252;rstentum Moskau eine f&#252;hrende Rolle, da es als erstes Land die mongolischen Kriegsherrn zur Abgabe von Steuern verpflichtete. Auf diese Weise gelang es den Prinzen Moskaus schlie&#223;lich, das Joch der mongolischen Unterdr&#252;ckung hinter sich zu lassen. Iwan III. (1462-1505) konsolidierte die Errungenschaften seines Vaters Wassili II. Doch erst sein kriegerischer Nachfolger Ivan IV. der Schreckliche (1533-84) war m&#228;chtig genug, sich zum Zar aller Russen kr&#246;nen zu lassen (1547). Die "Anh&#228;ufung der russischen L&#228;ndereien" wurde 500 Jahre lang von Moskau fortgesetzt, bis schlie&#223;lich alle slawischen Gebiete, sowohl die russischen Territorien als auch die wei&#223;russischen und ukrainischen Regionen, annektiert waren. Die Thronbesteigung Peters des Gro&#223;en (1694-1725) leitete die sozialen, politischen und intellektuellen Entwicklungen ein, die in den n&#228;chsten 200 Jahren in Russland vonstatten gehen sollten. Die Lage seiner Hauptstadt St. Petersburg am Ufer des Golfs von Finnland war das Symbol f&#252;r die einsetzende Europ&#228;isierung Russlands. W&#228;hrend der russische Adel das Hofzeremoniell und die milit&#228;rische Kultur des Westens &#252;bernahm, litt der Gro&#223;teil der russischen Bev&#246;lkerung jedoch weiterhin unter bitterer Armut und der traditionellen Leibeigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:2]Katharina die Gro&#223;e (1762-1796) erwies sich sp&#228;ter als die wahre intellektuelle und politische Erbin Peters des Gro&#223;en (obwohl sie mit diesem als deutsche Prinzessin nicht einmal verwandt war). Katharinas Herrschaft war von der Expansion des Reiches gepr&#228;gt. Am wichtigsten war hierbei die Sicherung des n&#246;rdlichen Ufers des Schwarzen Meeres, die Besetzung der Krim und die weitere Ausdehnung des Reiches in die Steppengebiete jenseits des Urals. Damit waren die russischen Bauernsiedlungen im S&#252;den gesch&#252;tzt, und zugleich konnten Handelswege durch das Schwarze Meer errichtet werden. Unterdessen verloren die Milit&#228;rdemokratien der Kosaken bei den Fl&#252;ssen Dnjepr, Don und Wolga ihre Autonomie und ihre privilegierte Sonderstellung; die wohlhabenderen Offiziere wurden zwar zu russischen Edelleuten ernannt und erhielten das Recht, Leibeigene zu besitzen und auf ihrem Land anzusiedeln, aber die tapferen Reiter wurden zu Bauern mit speziellen milit&#228;rischen Verpflichtungen degradiert. Die Teilung Polens f&#252;hrte Russland schlie&#223;lich noch weiter (wenn auch nur geografisch) an den Rest Europas heran. [PARAGRAPH:2]Trotz Peters und Katharinas Erbe herrschte in Russland zur Zeit von Nikolaus II. (1894-1917) das Chaos: Das Land befand sich in einem beschwerlichen Krieg und das Volk war von Armut und Unterdr&#252;ckung geplagt. Die Niederlage im russisch-japanischen Krieg nach der Revolution von 1905 zeigte &#252;berdeutlich, dass Russland drastischer Reformen bedurfte. Doch die aristokratische Struktur des Zarenreichs war auf den einsetzenden Wandel nur schlecht vorbereitet. Die von der Unzufriedenheit der russischen Bev&#246;lkerung getragene Revolution des Jahres 1917 besiegelte schlie&#223;lich den Untergang des alten Russlands. Die provisorische Regierung unter Ministerpr&#228;sident Kerenski versprach einen moderaten Ansatz, um die Probleme zu l&#246;sen, brach aber angesichts der bolschewistischen Revolution zusammen. Aufgrund des Herrschaftsanspruchs der Bolschewiken auf ganz Russland und den Rest des fr&#252;heren Zarenreiches war ein B&#252;rgerkrieg unvermeidbar, in dessen Verlauf sich die Kommunisten 1922 schlie&#223;lich gegen die Zaristen durchsetzten. Stalin sollte die Konsolidierung der kommunistischen Macht vollenden, die Lenin begonnen hatte. Stalin festigte seine Macht durch gezielten Terror gegen seine politischen Gegner. Ab 1928 war die russische Wirtschaft strengen F&#252;nfjahrespl&#228;nen unterworfen, die die Industrialisierung des Landes forcieren sollten. Obwohl mehrere, durch die Kollektivierung der Landwirtschaft bedingte, Hungersn&#246;te das russische Volk schw&#228;chten, avancierte die Sowjetunion unter Stalins F&#252;hrung nach dem 2. Weltkrieg zur Supermacht.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Kalte Krieg brachte die russische Wirtschaft jedoch an den Rand einer Katastrophe. W&#228;hrend die russische Wirtschaft Stahl f&#252;r unz&#228;hlige Panzer produzierte, fehlten in den russischen Haushalten selbst einfachste Dinge des t&#228;glichen Lebens. Michail Gorbatschow versuchte die stagnierende Wirtschaft der Sowjetunion durch eine Politik der wirtschaftlichen und politischen Entspannung zwar zu beleben, doch schon bald wurde er selbst ein Opfer der von ihm eingef&#252;hrten Reformen. Innerhalb weniger Jahre erkl&#228;rten die sowjetischen Satellitenstaaten ihre Unabh&#228;ngigkeit und junge Politiker, wie Boris Jelzin, forderten lautstark demokratische Wahlen. Im August 1991 wurde ein schlecht durchdachter, dilettantisch ausgef&#252;hrter und letztlich erfolgloser Putschversuch unternommen, um Jelzin seines Amtes zu entheben. Dennoch f&#252;hrte dieser Putsch das Ende der kommunistischen Partei herbei und beschleunigte die Aufl&#246;sung der Sowjetunion: Im Dezember 1991 erkl&#228;rte Jelzin die Union der Sozialistischen Sowjetrepubliken f&#252;r aufgel&#246;st, verbot die kommunistische Partei in Russland und beschlagnahmte deren Besitzt&#252;mer. Wenig sp&#228;ter wurde Jelzin zum ersten russischen Pr&#228;sidenten gew&#228;hlt. Heute ist das Land hin- und hergerissen zwischen einer Wirtschaft westlicher Pr&#228;gung und einem russischen Sonderweg.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]L'attuale territorio della Russia &#232; stato occupato dagli indo-europei, dagli urali-altaici e da altre razze fin dal 2000 a. C., ma poco si sa delle loro istituzioni e delle loro attivit&#224;. La moderna Russia risale circa al 770 d. C., quando gli esploratori Vichinghi intrapresero un'intensiva penetrazione nella regione del Volga. Dalle basi negli estuari lungo il Baltico orientale, le bande Scandinave, probabilmente alla ricerca di nuove vie commerciali a est, iniziarono a penetrare nel territorio popolato dalle trib&#249; Finniche e Slave, dove trovarono risorse naturali illimitate.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel giro di pochi decenni, i Rus, nome con cui erano conosciuti i coloni Vichinghi, assieme agli altri Scandinavi che operavano pi&#249; a ovest, estesero le loro attivit&#224; di razzia lungo le principali vie sui fiumi verso Baghdad e Costantinopoli, raggiungendo il Mar Nero nell'860. Nel periodo compreso fra il 930 e il 1000, la regione cadde sotto il completo dominio dei Rus, dominio esercitato dalla loro capitale a Kiev. La linfa vitale dell'Impero di Kiev era il commercio, organizzato dai principi Vichinghi. Intorno al 1000, i principi di Kiev furono convertiti al Cristianesimo dai missionari Bizantini e gli stati medioevali Russi mantennero stretti scambi culturali con i Bizantini. Lo stato unito di Kiev si divise nel 1054, sotto la pressione degli attacchi dei nomadi delle steppe, frammentando la Russia in numerosi principati indipendenti. Il devastante attacco dei Mongoli durante gli anni 1237-1240 caus&#242; la distruzione di numerose citt&#224;, la morte di civili e decret&#242; il crollo del ceto borghese, basato sul commercio delle pellicce. Ci&#242; contribu&#236; alla durata del lungo governo autocratico della Russia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tra i vari principati Russi, fu quello Moscovita a raggiungere il maggior successo. Inizialmente incaricati di riscuotere le tasse per i signori della guerra Mongoli, i principi Moscoviti rovesciarono infine i propri oppressori e ottennero una posizione di potere. Ivan III (1462-1505) consolid&#242; le conquiste che suo padre, Vasily II, aveva fatto quando era al potere e il suo discendente guerriero, Ivan IV(1533-1584), anche noto come Ivan il Terribile, guadagn&#242; abbastanza potere da ottenere il titolo di "Tsar", o Imperatore, nel 1547. Questa "acquisizione delle terre russe" divenne un impulso consapevole e irresistibile per cinque secoli, che spinse Mosca ad annettere tutte le terre Slave, sia i territori russi che le regioni della Bielorussia e dell'Ucraina. Dopo l'ascesa di Pietro I (1694-1725), noto come Pietro il Grande, vennero introdotte e affermate delle tendenze, in campo sociale, politico e intellettuale, che avrebbero contraddistinto la Russia per i due secoli successivi. La posizione della sua capitale, San Pietroburgo, sulle rive del Golfo di Finlandia, era il simbolo di questo avvicinamento alle vicende europee. Sebbene l'aristocrazia Russa avesse adottato i modi cortigiani e le moderne tattiche militari dell'occidente, la maggior parte della popolazione restava legata a uno stato di schiavit&#249; feudale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Caterina la Grande (1762-1796), una principessa tedesca non imparentata con Pietro, si sarebbe dimostrata la sua vera erede intellettuale e politica. Il suo regno fu considerevole per l'espansione imperiale. Le imprese pi&#249; importanti consistettero nella fortificazione della costa settentrionale del Mar Nero, nell'annessione della Crimea e nell'espansione nelle steppe al di l&#224; degli Urali. Tutto ci&#242; consent&#236; la protezione degli insediamenti agricoli russi a sud e la creazione di rotte commerciali attraverso il Mar Nero. Nel processo, le democrazie militari dei Cosacchi, insediate lungo i fiumi Dnieper, Don e Volga, persero la loro autonomia e i privilegi speciali. Gli ufficiali pi&#249; benestanti divennero nobili russi e ricevettero il diritto di disporre di servi sulle loro terre, mentre i feroci cavalieri scesero al livello di contadini con speciali obblighi militari. La partizione della Polonia da parte di Caterina contribu&#236; anche ad avvicinare la Russia al resto dell'Europa, almeno geograficamente.[PARAGRAPH:2]Malgrado l'eredit&#224; di Pietro e di Caterina, ai tempi di Nicola II (1894-1917) la Russia era allo sbando, afflitta dalla miseria e dall'oppressione. La sconfitta nella guerra Russo-Giapponese, seguita dalla rivoluzione del 1905, indica che la Russia aveva un estremo bisogno di riforme drastiche, ma la struttura antartica dello stato zarista non era indicato per adattarsi ai cambiamenti. La Prima Guerra Mondiale esercit&#242; sul governo una pressione che questi non era in grado di sopportare e, di conseguenza, nel 1917 scoppi&#242; la Rivoluzione Russa, su un'ondata di malcontento popolare. Il governo provvisorio di Kerensky, un tentativo moderato di risolvere i problemi, croll&#242; dinanzi alla Rivoluzione Bolscevica (Comunista). Considerato il desiderio dei Bolscevichi di dominare l'intera Russia e il resto del precedente impero zarista, la guerra civile era inevitabile, e la lotta tra le forze Rosse (i Comunisti) e quelle Bianche (gli Zaristi) dur&#242; fino alla vittoria bolscevica, nel 1922. Stalin avrebbe completato il consolidamento del potere comunista, introdotto da Lenin, attraverso l'industrializzazione forzata del Piano dei Cinque Anni e le carestie dovute alla collettivizzazione dell'agricoltura. Nonostante il livello disumano di sofferenza imposto al popolo, Stalin govern&#242; la Russia durante la pi&#249; grande minaccia per la sua esistenza durante l'invasione nazista del 1941-1945, aiutandola a emergere come una delle superpotenze del mondo in seguito alla Seconda Guerra Mondiale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tuttavia, nella Guerra Fredda che segu&#236; agli eventi, l'economia della Russia fu vicina al collasso. Il sistema economico comunista aveva funzionato adeguatamente quando era stato necessario produrre milioni di tonnellate di ferro per i carro armati, ma non era in grado di garantire i beni di tutti i giorni necessari alla popolazione. Mikhail Gorbachev cerc&#242; di riattivare la stagnante economia Sovietica attraverso l'allentamento del controllo economico e politico, ma la libert&#224; di parola e di mercato sfociarono in ci&#242; che Gorbachev non avrebbe mai immaginato: entro pochi anni, le citt&#224; satellite Sovietiche dell'Est Europa dichiararono la propria dipendenza e i nuovi politici, come Boris Yeltsin, chiesero a gran voce delle elezioni democratiche. Nell'agosto del 1991 ci fu in colpo di stato, concepito, progettato ed eseguito malissimo, il cui obiettivo era quello di rimuovere Yeltsin e, mettendo fine al predominio del Partito Comunista, accelerare il movimento di dissoluzione dell'Unione Sovietica. Yeltsin sciolse l'Unione delle Repubbliche Socialiste Sovietiche nel dicembre del 1991, dichiarando illegale il Partito Comunista in Russia, confiscandone tutte le propriet&#224; e diventando il primo presidente di Russia. Al giorno d'oggi, come in passato, la Russia si ritrova incerta se seguire l'esempio occidentale o cercare un proprio percorso di sviluppo.</Italian>

La Rusia moderna se remonta aproximadamente al 770 d. C., cuando los exploradores vikingos comenzaron una penetraci&#243;n intensiva en la zona del Volga. Desde sus bases situadas en varios estuarios a lo largo del B&#225;ltico oriental, estos grupos escandinavos, probablemente en busca de nuevas rutas comerciales hacia el este, comenzaron a introducirse en territorio poblado por tribus finesas y eslavas, en donde encontraron ilimitados recursos naturales. [PARAGRAPH:2]En cuesti&#243;n de pocas d&#233;cadas, los rus, nombre por el que se conoc&#237;a a los colonos vikingos, junto con otros escandinavos que actuaban m&#225;s al oeste, extendieron sus incursiones hacia el sur por las principales rutas fluviales que iban a Bagdad y Constantinopla, y alcanzaron el Mar Negro en el 860. En el periodo comprendido entre el 930 y el 1000, la regi&#243;n pas&#243; a estar bajo el completo dominio de los rus, desde su capital de Kiev. El alma del expansionismo del imperio de Kiev era el comercio organizado por los pr&#237;ncipes vikingos. Alrededor del a&#241;o 1000, los pr&#237;ncipes de Kiev fueron convertidos al cristianismo por misioneros bizantinos, y los estados rusos medievales mantendr&#237;an importantes lazos culturales con Bizancio. El principado de Kiev se desmoron&#243; en 1054, tras el ataque de los n&#243;madas de las estepas, y Rusia se fragment&#243; en una serie de estados independientes. El devastador ataque mongol de 1237-40 provoc&#243; la destrucci&#243;n de muchas ciudades, p&#233;rdida de vidas y desaparici&#243;n de una clase media mercantil centrada en el comercio de pieles. Esto contribuy&#243; al advenimiento de la tradici&#243;n autocr&#225;tica en Rusia.[PARAGRAPH:2]De los diferentes principados, fue el de Moscovia el que tuvo m&#225;s &#233;xito. Los pr&#237;ncipes de Moscovia, que empezaron siendo los recaudadores de impuestos de los se&#241;ores mongoles, acabaron por alcanzar una posici&#243;n de predominio sacudi&#233;ndose el yugo de sus opresores. Iv&#225;n III (1462-1505) consolid&#243; los logros que su padre, Vasily II, hab&#237;a obtenido luchando, y su belicoso descendiente, Iv&#225;n IV (1533-84), conocido como Iv&#225;n el Terrible, reuni&#243; el poder suficiente para adoptar el t&#237;tulo de "zar", o emperador, en 1547. Esta ?unificaci&#243;n de las tierras rusas? se convirti&#243; durante cinco siglos en un impulso expreso e irresistible para que Mosc&#250; se anexionase todas las tierras eslavas, tanto en los territorios rusos como en las regiones ucranianas y bielorrusas.  La subida al trono de Pedro I (1694-1725), conocido como "el Grande", marc&#243; el comienzo de las tendencias sociales, pol&#237;ticas e intelectuales imperantes en Rusia durante los dos siglos siguientes. El establecimiento de su nueva capital, San  Petersburgo, en las costas del golfo de Finlandia simboliz&#243; una transformaci&#243;n encaminada a una mayor intervenci&#243;n en los asuntos de Europa. Sin embargo, aunque puede que la aristocracia rusa hubiese adoptado el comportamiento cortesano y las modernas t&#225;cticas militares del oeste, la mayor&#237;a del pueblo ruso permanec&#237;a sumido en un estado de servidumbre feudal no muy diferente a la esclavitud.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catalina la Grande (1762-1796), aunque era una princesa alemana sin ning&#250;n parentesco con Pedro, acabar&#237;a por convertirse en su aut&#233;ntica heredera pol&#237;tica e intelectual. Su reinado destac&#243; por la expansi&#243;n del imperio. La anexi&#243;n de Crimea y la expansi&#243;n por las estepas situadas m&#225;s all&#225; de los Urales tuvieron enorme importancia a la hora de asegurar la costa norte del Mar Negro. Esto posibilit&#243; la protecci&#243;n de los asentamientos agr&#237;colas rusos en el sur y el establecimiento de rutas comerciales a trav&#233;s del Mar Negro. Mientras tanto, las comunidades democr&#225;ticas y militares de las huestes cosacas asentadas en los r&#237;os Dni&#233;per, Don y Volga perdieron su autonom&#237;a y sus privilegios especiales; los oficiales m&#225;s acomodados se convirtieron en nobles rusos y recibieron el derecho a poseer siervos y colonizar con ellos sus propias tierras, mientras los feroces jinetes se ve&#237;an reducidos al rango de campesinos con obligaciones militares especiales. La partici&#243;n de Polonia llevada a cabo por Catalina permiti&#243; tambi&#233;n acercar Rusia al resto de Europa, al menos desde el punto de vista geogr&#225;fico.[PARAGRAPH:2]A pesar del legado de Pedro y Catalina, en la &#233;poca de Nicol&#225;s II (1894-1917) el desorden reinaba en Rusia, asolada por la miseria y la opresi&#243;n en el interior. La derrota cosechada en la guerra ruso-japonesa, seguida por la Revoluci&#243;n de 1905, demostr&#243; que Rusia necesitaba reformas dr&#225;sticas, pero la estructura autocr&#225;tica del estado zarista estaba muy mal preparada para adaptarse a condiciones cambiantes. La Primera Guerra Mundial impuso una presi&#243;n al imperio ruso que no pudo soportar, y en 1917, una oleada de descontento popular acab&#243; por provocar la revoluci&#243;n. El gobierno provisional de Kerensky, un intento moderado por resolver los problemas, se derrumb&#243; ante la revoluci&#243;n comunista bolchevique. El deseo de los bolcheviques de dominar la totalidad de Rusia y del resto del imperio zarista hizo inevitable la guerra, y estall&#243; un amargo conflicto entre los rojos (comunistas) y los blancos (zaristas), de la que aqu&#233;llos emergieron victoriosos en 1922. Stalin completar&#237;a la consolidaci&#243;n del poder comunista iniciada por Lenin, principalmente por medio de la industrializaci&#243;n forzosa de los planes quinquenales y las hambrunas masivas provocadas por la colectivizaci&#243;n de la agricultura. A pesar de imponer un nivel de sufrimiento casi insoportable al pueblo ruso, Stalin dirigir&#237;a a la Uni&#243;n Sovi&#233;tica en la mayor amenaza a su existencia, la invasi&#243;n nazi de 1941-45, y contribuir&#237;a a la consolidaci&#243;n de su papel como superpotencia mundial tras el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pero en la Guerra Fr&#237;a que sigui&#243;, la econom&#237;a de Rusia se desplomar&#237;a tras un largo proceso de decadencia. El sistema econ&#243;mico comunista era capaz de producir millones de toneladas de hierro para la fabricaci&#243;n de tanques, pero no de producir sencillos bienes de menaje dom&#233;stico para mejorar la vida cotidiana de la gente. Mijail Gorbachov trat&#243; de revivir la estancada econom&#237;a sovi&#233;tica relajando los controles econ&#243;micos y pol&#237;ticos, pero la fuerza de la libertad de expresi&#243;n y mercado se manifest&#243; r&#225;pidamente de un modo que Gorbachov nunca habr&#237;a imaginado. En cuesti&#243;n de pocos a&#241;os, los sat&#233;lites sovi&#233;ticos de la Europa Oriental estaban declarando la independencia, mientras pol&#237;ticos nuevos como Boris Yeltsin exig&#237;an elecciones democr&#225;ticas. En agosto de 1991 se produjo un intento de golpe de estado irreflexivo, mal planeado y p&#233;simamente ejecutado para deponer a Yeltsin, lo que acab&#243; poniendo fin al Partido Comunista y acelerando el movimiento para deshacer la Uni&#243;n Sovi&#233;tica. Yeltsin disolvi&#243; la Uni&#243;n de Rep&#250;blicas Socialistas Sovi&#233;ticas en diciembre de 1991, ilegaliz&#243; el Partido Comunista en Rusia y le arrebat&#243; todas sus propiedades, convirti&#233;ndose en el primer presidente del pa&#237;s. En la actualidad, como tantas otras veces le ha ocurrido a lo largo de su historia, Rusia se enfrenta al dilema de seguir el ejemplo de occidente o seguir una senda propia de desarrollo.</Spanish>

Alexandr ran away from home at the age of fifteen. He became a successful merchant in Irkutsk, Siberia. He was lured to Russian America, by the growing fur trade there.

		<English>[TAB]The Carib, after whom the Caribbean was named, are believed to have originally migrated from the Orinoco River region in South America, settling throughout the Lesser Antilles by about 1200 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1] During the century leading up to the Spanish discovery of the New World, the Carib who were skilled boat builders and sailors came to dominate the Caribbean archipelago through a combination of warfare, extermination and assimilation, displacing the Maipurean-speaking Tainos, who had previously settled many of the islands. As the Europeans came into contact with the Carib's, stories of cannibalism were noted. Often taking human limbs as trophies, some Carib tribes would chew and spit out one mouthful of flesh to absorb the bravery of their fallen enemy. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Carib's ever ate human flesh to satisfy hunger.[PARAGRAPH:1] The 'Black Carib's of St. Vincent and Dominica, known as Garifuna, were descended from slaves who had escaped or had been marooned from shipwrecks. They intermarried with the Carib, and their resistance delayed the settlement of Dominica by the British. In 1795 the Garifuna were transported to Roatan Island off of Honduras. Their descendents continue to live there. By the end of the 18th century, the Carib's had been driven from almost all of the islands they had once inhabited suffering great loss of life either through fatalities to disease, or through warfare with European settlers. The last known speakers of Island Carib died in the 1920s, and the language is now considered extinct.</English>

Die ersten Eurp&#228;er, die Kontakt zu den Caribs aufnahmen berichteten auch von Kanibalismus. Oft wurden K&#246;rperteile get&#246;teter Feinde als Troph&#228;en vorgezeigt. Belegt ist auch, dass einige St&#228;mme der Carib tats&#228;chlich kleine Mengen des Fleisches get&#246;teter Gegner zu sich nahmen um deren Mut zu absorbieren. Es gibt jedoch keine Beweise, dass die Carib jemals Menschenfleisch gegessen haben um ihren Hunger zu befriedigen.[PARAGRAPH:1] Die 'Scharzen Carib' von St. Vincent und Dominica, auch als Garifuna bekannt, ware Nachkommen geflohener Sklaven.

Ende des 18ten Jahrhunderts waren die Carib beinahe von allen Inseln vertrieben, die sie urpr&#252;nglich besiedelt hatten.

By the end of the 18th century, many Navajo groups facing increased raids from the Ute's, Comanche's and Apaches, moved their livestock to lands further west. The Navajo continued to engage in a series of sporadic raids and counter- raids, throughout the first half of the 19th century, fighting against not only their Indian neighbors and the Spanish, but later the Mexicans, and finally the United States.

Ihre Vorfahren migrierten um 1400 AD vom &#246;stlichen Alaska und nordwestlichen Kanada, in den amerikanischen S&#252;dwesten um sich dort niederzulassen.[PARAGRAPH:1] Als die Spanier w&#228;hrend des 16ten Jarhunderts in dieser Gegend eintrafen, nahm der Brauch der Navajo ihre Nachbarn zu &#252;berfallen stetig, durch die von den Spaniern erworbenen Waffen und Pferde unterst&#252;tzt, zu. Als die spanischen Missionen ihren Druck erh&#246;hten, flohen viele Pueblo Indianer zu den Navajo, da dort die spanischen Missionen, aufgrund der halbnomadischen Lebensweise der Navajo, nie erfolgreich etabliert werden konnten. Die Pueblo Indianer die zur&#252;ckblieben organisierten erfolgreich einen Widerstand, der die Spanier wieder aus Neu-Mexiko vertrieb. Als die Spanier verschwunden waren, wurden die D&#246;rfer der Pueblo Indianer jedoch von verst&#228;rkten &#252;berf&#228;llen der Najao heimgesucht. 1692 erorberten die Spanier Neu-Mexiko zur&#252;ck, was erneut dazu f&#252;hrte das einige Pueblo Indianer zu freundlich gesinnten Najao flohen.[PARAGRAPH:1] Zu Beginn des 18ten Jahrhunderts fanden die Feindseligkeiten zwischen den Spaniern und den Pueblo Indianern ein Ende und viele Pueblo kehrten in ihre Heimatgebiete zur&#252;ck. Manche k&#228;mpften sogar auf deren Seite gegen Navajo, Apachen und Ute Indianer. Zu dieser Zeit sahen sich die Najao auch verst&#228;rkten &#252;berf&#228;llen von Ute Indianern, Commanchen und Apachen ausgesetzt. Die Navajo ihrerseits setzte ebenfalls die &#252;berf&#228;lle und Gegenangriffe fort.

Dies fand schliesslich im sogenanten 'Long Walk' 1864 seinen H&#246;hepunkt als die United States Army die Navajo von ihren angestammten L&#228;ndern in ein Reservat im &#246;stlichen Neu-Mexiko, heute Arizona, vertrieb. 1868 durften die Najao wieder zur&#252;ck in ihr altes Gebiet und bekamen 3.5 million Ar Land zwischen ihren vier heiligen Bergen zugesprochen.</German>

Their ancestors migrated from Eastern Alaska and Northwestern Canada, and by 1400 AD, had settled in the American southwest.[PARAGRAPH:1] With the arrival of the Spanish in the southwest, during the 16th century, the Navajo practice of raiding their neighbors steadily increased, aided by the new additions of Spanish horses and guns. As the Spanish missions became more heavy handed, many Pueblo Indians fled to the Navajo, whom the Spanish missionaries had never established much success with, given the Navajo's semi-nomadic nature. Those Pueblo that remained organized a successful resistance to Spanish authority and drove the Spanish away from New Mexico. With the Spanish gone the Navajo turned to increased raids against Pueblo villages. In 1692, the Spanish re-conquered New Mexico, driving some Pueblo Indians again to live with friendly Navajo groups.[PARAGRAPH:1] By the beginning of the 18th century, hostilities between the Spanish and the Pueblo Indians had subsided, leading to many Pueblo families returning to their Pueblo homes, and siding with the Spanish to fight off raids made by the Navajo, Apache and Ute. By the end of the 18th century, many Navajo groups facing increased raids from the Ute's, Comanche's and Apaches, moved their livestock to lands further west. The Navajo continued to engage in a series of sporadic raids and counter- raids, throughout the first half of the 19th century, fighting against not only their Indian neighbors and the Spanish, but later the Mexicans, and finally the United States. This cycle finally culminated in the Long Walk of 1864, when the United States Army forced the Navajo from their lands in what is now Arizona onto a reservation in eastern New Mexico. By 1868, attempts to sustain the reservation had failed and the Navajo were relocated back to their traditional boundaries, being granted 3.5 million acres of land between their four sacred mountains.</Spanish>

Die Algonquian waren oft in Grenzkriegen, speziell mit den Engl&#228;ndern verwickelt, jedoch war der Kampf um den Besitz ihres Territoriums letztlich aussichtslos. Kaum f&#228;hig eine regionale standhafte und andauernde Allianz zu bilden, wurde der Wiederstand der Algonquian von Maine bis in den Mittleren Westen zerschlagen und lies nur Bruchst&#252;cke der Stammesorganisationen zur&#252;ck. Eine St&#228;mme flohen nach Kanada, andere migrierten &#252;ber die Allegheny Berge in das Ohio Tal.

Die Irokesen trieben die Algonquians nach Norden in die Region der Oberen Great Lakes und westlich in die Indiana Territorien. Die Algonquian, die den Ohio &#252;berschritten, bildeten eine lose Konf&#246;dertaion mit anderen St&#228;mmen die nach Westen vertrieben wurden und alliierten sich zuerst mit den Franzosen und sp&#228;ter mit den Engl&#228;ndern in der Hoffnung so ihr Territorium for weiterer Besiedelung durch den Weissen Mann zu sch&#252;tzen. Die St&#228;mme im Ohio Tal hielten ihren Wiederstand bis nach der Revolution aufrecht, wurden aber letztlich im Northwest Indian War in den Jahren 1785-95 besiegt. Der Vertrag von Greenville 1795 besiegelte die Aufgabe aller L&#228;nder westlich des Ohio. Tecumseh versuchte den indianischen Wiederstand 1811 wiederzubeleben, aber sein Tod 1813 beendete alle Opposition der Algonquian.

The Appomattoc first encountered the English in May 1607, and despite initially welcoming the Europeans, they soon along with other neighboring tribes were making sporadic raids against the English until Chief Powhatan ordered a ceasefire.

Ever short of food, and unable to grow it for themselves, the English sent out parties to either trade for or raid food from the local Indian tribes. In the fall of 1610, Oppussoquionuske took advantage of this  weakness and invited an English trading party to her village, killing all but one of the party in an ambush. In reprisal for the attack, the English under Sir Thomas Dale, raided the Appomattoc around Christmas 1611. Oppussoquionuske's village was seized and burnt to the ground, and Oppussoquinuske who was mortally wounded in the attack died shortly afterwards. Dale renamed the site of the former Appomattoc village New Bermuda, and the settlement of Bermuda Hundred was incorporated there in 1614.</English>

Die Appomattoc trafen zum ersten Mal im Mai 1607 auf die Engl&#228;nder und obwohl sie diese anfangs Willkommen hiessen, begannen sie bald zusammen mit anderen benachbarten St&#228;mmen mit sporadischen &#252;berf&#228;llen auf die Engl&#228;nder, bis H&#228;uptling Powhatan eine Waffenruhe befahl. [PARAGRAPH:1] Bis 1609, hatten die Beziehungen zwischen den Engl&#228;ndern und der Powathan Konf&#246;deration starken Schaden genommen, was 1610-1611 zum ersten Anglo-Powhatan Krieg f&#252;hrte. Knapp an Essen und unf&#228;hig Nahrung selber ausreichend anzubauen, entsandten die Engl&#228;nder Gruppen um entweder um Nahrung zu handeln oder dies von den lokalen St&#228;mmen zu rauben. Im Herbst 1610 nutzte Oppussoquionuske diese Schw&#228;che aus und lud eine englische Handelsgesandschaft in ihr Dorf ein und t&#246;tete in einem Hinterhalt alle bis auf einen einzigen Mann. Als Rache f&#252;r diesen Angriff &#252;berfielen wiederum die Engl&#228;nder unter Sir Thomas Dale die Appomattoc im Winter 1611. Oppussoquionuskes Dorf wurde vollst&#228;ndig niedergebrannt und Oppussoquinuske selbst w&#228;hrend des Angriffs t&#246;dlich verwundet, wodurch sie kurz danach auch starb. Dale benannte die St&#228;tte der fr&#252;heren Appomattoc Siedlung in New Bermuda um und 1614 wurde dort die Siedlung Bermuda Hundred gegr&#252;ndet.</German>

Er war ein dominikanischer Priester, der 1542 die Expedition von Francisco de Orellana entlang des Amazonas begleitete. Carvajal berichtete von einer bev&#246;lkerungsreichen und organisierten Gesellschaft, die hunderte von Meilen entlang des Amazonas kontrollierte, schrieb jedoch sehr wenig &#252;ber die Menschen des Amazonas selbst, was haupts&#228;chlich daran lag, dass diese versuchten ihn zu t&#246;ten.

Twenty years later the expedition of Ursua was met with similar hostility, forcing a second wave of Spanish to quickly leave Machiparo territory. Whether or not Machipara was still alive to order these attacks is unknown.</Spanish>

		<German>[TAB]Der Begriff Mixtec stammt von dem Nahuatl Wort 'mixtecah' ab, welches 'Wolkenvok' bedeutet. Vor der Ankunft der Europ&#228;er, waren die Mixtec eine der bekannteste Zivilisatione in Mittelamerika, aufgrund ihrer fortschrittlichen Geb&#228;ude, weitreichendem Wissen in der Astronomie und ihrer feinen Goldschmiedearbeiten. Durch Migration in das Oaxca Tal begegneten die Mixtec der alten Zapotec Zivilisation und bauten viele verlassene St&#228;dte der Zapotec wieder auf. In einem lang andauernden Kampf erlangten die Mixtec schrittweise die Kontrolle &#252;ber das Oaxca Tal von den Zapotec.

She was also known as Lady Six Monkey, which refers to her day of birth within the 260-day Aztec calendar, which cycled through 13 numbers and 20 various signs. Lady Six Monkey became heir of Xaltepec after a dynastic struggle for power, which resulted in the deaths of several elder siblings. The crisis impelled her to seek guidance from the priestess of the Death Cave (Huahi Cahi) in Chalcatongo. The priestess, Lady Nine Grass, instructed her to marry Lord Eleven Wind, heir to the Xipe Bundle, a marriage which would secure both of their monarchial claims. On the way to her husband's town, her party passed through the settlements of Mountain of the Moon and Mountain of the Insect (probably Yucu Yoo-Tiyuqh). There her ambassadors were insulted with the words "knife, knife," which in Mixtec usually meant a curse or threat. Lady Six Monkey used these words as a pretext for declaring war and launched an attack, leaving both settlements in flames. She captured the offending princes and sacrificed them. Following her military victory, her name was changed from "Serpent Quechquemitl" to "War Quechquemitl." She had two children, Lord Four Wind, who became the ruler of Town of Flints (uu Yuchi), and Lord One Lizard, who was her successor in Xaltepec. In 1101 her archrival, the great Mixtec warchief,  Lord Eight Deer, attacked the town of Xipe Bundle and killed both Lady Six Monkey and her husband. Lord Eight Deer himself was eventually captured and sacrificed in 1115 by Lady Six Monkey's son, Lord Four Wind. </English>

Sie wurde F&#252;hrerin der Xaltepec nachdem sie in einem Dynastiekonflikt um die Macht als Siegerin hervorging, der den Tod mehrere &#228;lterer Geschwister zur Folge hatte. Die Krise zwang sie bei einer Priesterin der Todesh&#246;hlen (Huahi Cahi) in Chalcatongo um Rat zu suchen. Die Priesterin, 'Herrin Neun Gr&#228;ser' instruierte sie den 'Herrn Elf Winde" zu heiraten, der Erbe von Xipe Bundle war, um die Herrschaftsanspr&#252;che beider Parteien zu sichern. Auf dem Weg in die Stadt ihres Ehemannes, passierte ihre Gruppe die D&#246;rfer 'Berg des Mondes' und 'Berg des Insekts' (wahrscheinlich Yucu Yoo-Tiyuqh). Dort wurden sie mit den Worten 'Messer, Messer' empfangen, was in der Sprache der Mixtec eine Verw&#252;nschung darstellte. 'Herrin Sechs Affen' griff daraufhin die Siedlungen an und lies sie brennend zur&#252;ck. Die verantwortliche Prinzessin wurde gefangen und den G&#246;ttern geopfert.

		<English>[TAB]The Muisca are the Chibca-speaking peoples that inhabited the central highlands of present-day Columbia. The Muisca were the third largest indigenous group in America, although they were not a united people. The majority of power was divided between two confederations, the Hunza, of the northern highland area, whose ruler was known as the Zaque; and the Bacat of the southern highland area, whose ruler was known as the Zipa. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Hunza and Bacata were regularly at war with one another, with each continually enlisting the loyalty and support of neighboring city states against the other. When the Spanish arrived in 1537, the Hunza and Bacat both tried to use the Spanish in the same way, hoping that a war between the Spanish and one confederation would leave both combatants weakened enough for the remaining confederation to take power and establish a single Muisca political state. However, the Spanish quickly took advantage of the Muisca rivalry, and killed the last Muisca sovereigns, Sagipa and Aquiminzaque. In 1542 the Spanish put down the last Muisca resistance and the territories of both Confederations were included in a new Colonial Spanish political division named Nuevo Reino de Granada. [PARAGRAPH:1]The origin of the legend of El Dorado -gilded person- may have be located in the Muisca Confederation. The Zaque and the Zipa would often cover themselves in gold when offering tributes and other treasure to their gods, a practice that was well known outside of the confederation as far off as the Caribbean. The Spanish were attracted by such stories of gold, and eventually the legend grew to represent a mythical city of gold.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Die Muisca sind ein Chibca-sprchendes Volk, welches die zentralen Hochlande des heutigen Kolumbien bewohnte. Sie waren die dritt gr&#246;sste gruppe von Ureinwohnern in Amerika, allerdings keint vereintes Volk. Die meiste Macht war zwischen zwei Konf&#246;derationen aufgeteilt, den Hunza im Norden, deren Anf&#252;hrer als Zaque bekannt war, und die Bacata im S&#252;den, deren Anf&#252;hrer als Zipa bekannt war. [PARAGRAPH:1]Die Hunza und Bacata waren regelm&#228;ssig miteinander im Krieg. Loyalit&#228;t und Unterst&#252;tzung von benachbarten Stadtstaaten wechselte oft die Seiten. Als die Spanier 1537 eintrafen, versuchte sowohl die Hunza, wie auch die Bacata diese auf die selbe Art und Weise einzusetzen und hofften, dass ein Konflikt mit den Spaniern die Gegenseite geschw&#228;cht genug zur&#252;cklassen w&#252;rde um es der verbliebenen Seite zu erlauben die gesamte Macht zu &#252;bernehmen und einen vereinten Muisca Staat zu schaffen. Die Spanier zogen jedoch schnell ihre eigenen Vorteile aus der Rivalit&#228;t der Musica und t&#246;teten die letzten Herrscher der Musisca, Sagipa und Aquiminzaque. 1542 rangen die Spanier den letzten Muisca Wiederstand nieder und die Territorien beider Konf&#246;derationen wurden unter dem Namen 'Nuevo Reino de Granada' Teil des spanischen Kolonialreiches. [PARAGRAPH:1]Der Ursprung der El Dorado legende k&#246;nnte in der Muisca Konf&#246;deration begr&#252;ndet sein. Sowohl der Zaque, wie auch der Zipa, bedeckten sich oft mit Gold um ihren G&#246;tter Tribute und Sch&#228;tze anzubieten. Dies war auch ausserhalb der Konf&#246;derationen, sogar bis in die Karibik, wohl bekannt. Die Spanier wurden nat&#252;rlich von solchen Geschichten von Gold und Reichtum angezogen und irgendwann wuchs diese Geschichte zu der Legende der msystischen Stadt aus Gold.</German>

Quemuenchatocha ceased hostilities and managed to forge an uneasy truce with the Zipa of the Bacat, Nemequene, which lasted until 1514. Aware of Nemequene attempts to build alliances amongst neighboring tribes, Quemuenchatocha declared war on the Bacat. Both armies met in at the Stream of the Laps in 1514, where Quemuenchatocha allegedly suggested he and Nemequene fight hand to hand so to avoid bloodshed. Nemequene rejected the offer and his army won the battle, yet Nemequene was mortally wounded, and his army retreated. [PARAGRAPH:1] Learning of the Spanish in his lands, Quemuenchatocha, withdrew to his palace, and maintained a repressive policy with his town, which increased its incapacity to govern. He sent gifts and envoys of peace to the Spanish, seeking to slow them down so he could hide his wealth. Finally in August 1537, the Spanish arrived finding Quemuenchatocha in his throne room, decorated in fine fabrics and gold, though alone, his advisors and guards having fled before the Spanish advance. The Spanish took him to the nearby city of Suesca hoping to find where he had hidden the rest of his treasure, but were unsuccessful. Quemuenchatocha was forced to abdicate in favor of his nephew Aquiminzaque, and died soon after in 1538.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Comanche emerged as a separate group shortly before 1700, when they parted from the Shoshone people.

		<German>[TAB]Die Comanchen erschienen als eigenst&#228;ndiger Stamm kurz vor 1700, als sie sich vom Volk der Shoshonen l&#246;sten. Diese Abspaltung geschah zur selben Zeit, als sie von den Pueblo Indianern Pferde erwarben, was ihnen erm&#246;glichte ihre Jagdgebiete stark auszuweiten. Die Migration der Comanchen f&#252;hrte sie zu den s&#252;dlichen Great Plains, die die Comanchen Comancheria nannten, ein Gebiet, dass sich vom heutigen Arkansas Fluss bis in das zentrale Texas erstreckte. W&#228;hrend der Migration wuchs die Bev&#246;lerkung der Comanchen signifikant aufgrund des reichen Nahrungsvorkommens in Form von B&#252;ffeln, die Ankunft von weiteren Shoshone Migranten, und die Aufnahme von geraubten Kindern und Frauen aus anderen St&#228;mmen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Trotz ihrer stark gewachsenen Zahl bildeten die Comanchen nie ein geeintes Volk, sondern blieben stets ein Dutzend eigenst&#228;ndige St&#228;mme.

Die Zahl der Pferde in der Comancheria zu dieser Zeit wird auf 2 Millionen gesch&#228;tzt. Mitte des 19ten Jahrhunderts verkaufeten sie Pferde and franz&#246;sische und amerikansiche H&#228;ndler. [PARAGRAPH:1] Die Beziehungen der Comachen zu den Europ&#228;ern und sp&#228;ter zu den Amerikanern, die in ihrem Gebiet zu siedeln versuchten, blieben angespannt, da diese gleichzeitig gesch&#228;tzte Handelspartner aber auch Gegner in Bezug auf die territorialen Rechte waren. Krieg war Teil des normalen Lebens der Comanchen und sie entwickelten viele Strategien um auf Pferden zu k&#228;mpfen, wie berittene &#252;berf&#228;lle, die unausweichlich dazu f&#252;hrten, dass sich die Comachen mit fast jedem anderen Stamm in den Great Plains im Krieg befanden. In den 1860ern k&#228;mpften die Comachen gegen die Truppen der United States. Als aber um 1875, die B&#252;ffelherden dezimiert wurden und ihre Bev&#246;lkerung durch Krankheiten und Kriege geschw&#228;cht war, ergaben sich die letzten Comanche und zogen sichin Reservate zur&#252;ck.</German>

However, his jacket failed to protect him from the Buffalo gun of the Tonkawa Indian Jim Pockmark, who shot and killed the Comanche chief.

These raids led to the Bear River Massacre of 1863, where US forces trapped and murdered 350-500 Shoshone who were in their winter camps.

Um 1700 wurden die Ost-Shoshonen durch Kriege und den Druck der rivalisierende St&#228;mme nach S&#252;den und Westen gezwungen, was dazu f&#252;hrte, dass einige sogar bis nach Texas migrierten, wo sie zu den Comanchen wurden. [PARAGRAPH:1] Mit der immer weiter westlich in das Land der Shoshonen vordringenden Europ&#228;isch-Amerikanischen Besiedlung, befanden sich die Shoshonen oft im Krieg mit dem Weissen Mann, besonders in der zweiten H&#228;lfte des 19ten Jahrhunderts. Unter der F&#252;hrung von H&#228;uptling Pocatello, bek&#228;mpften die Nord-Shoshonen die Siedler in Idaho bis in die 1860er hinein, indem sie Farmen und Ranches &#252;berfielen. Dies f&#252;hrte 1863 zum Bear River Massaker bei dem US Truppen 350 bis 500 Shoshonen, die gerade ihre Winterlager errichtet hatten, einschlossen und ermordeten. [PARAGRAPH:1] Mit den Bannock and Paiute verb&#252;ndet, setzten die Shoshonen sporadisch ihren Kampf gegen die United States fort. Bedeutendere Ereignisse dabei sind der Schlangenkrieg 1864 bis 1868 und der Bannock Krieg von 1878. Der bekannteste Shoshone ist vermutlich Sacagawea von den Nord-Shoshonen, weil er als ein Schl&#252;sselteilnehmer der Expedition von Lewis and Clark gilt, die 1804-1806 weite Teile des bis dahin kaum kartographierten westliche Nordamerika erkundete.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]The Shoshone, sometimes called the Snake Indians by early European trappers, travelers, and settlers, are members of the much larger Uto-Aztecan language group. Residing in an area from the Great Basin to coastal Southern California in present-day United States, the Shoshoni were divided into three branches, the Northern, Eastern, and Western Shoshoni. From the 1700's onwards, warfare and pressure from rival tribes, pushed the Eastern Shoshone south and westward, resulting in some of the Shoshoni moving as far south as Texas where they were become the Comanche. [PARAGRAPH:1] With the European-American migration westwards into Shoshone lands, the Shoshone often found themselves at war with the whites, especially in the second half of the 19th century. Under the leadership of Chief Pocatello, the Northern Shoshone fought settlers in Idaho throughout the 1860's raiding their farms and ranches. These raids led to the Bear River Massacre of 1863, where US forces trapped and murdered 350-500 Shoshone who were in their winter camps. [PARAGRAPH:1] Allied with the Bannock and Paiute people, the Shoshone continued to sporadically fight against the United States in the Snake War, 1864-1868, and the Bannock War of 1878. The most renowned Shoshone is probably Sacagawea, from the Northern Shoshone's Lemhi band. Sacagawea is famous for being a key participant in Lewis and Clark's, Corps of Discovery during its expedition of the Western United States, 1804-1806.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB] The Crow, are also known as the Apsaalooke or the Absaroka, which in their own Siouan language means either Sparrowhawk or bird people. The French who were the first Europeans to encounter the Crow in the mid 18th century, mistranslated the name to gens du corbeaux (people of the crows), thereafter becoming known in English as the Crow. [PARAGRAPH:1] The Crow resided on the Great Plains within the Yellowstone River valley, although they were originally believed to have been from the Ohio valley region, but migrated west in the face of the better armed Cree and Ojibwas, and then forced further westward by the Cheyenne and then the Sioux. Encountering Europeans in 1743, the Crow quickly acquired and became adept horsemen, though consequently found themselves regularly raided by the Blackfoot Confederacy, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Pawnee, Ute and Lakota tribes, who chose to steal horses rather than trade for them. [PARAGRAPH:1] The 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie with the United States, guaranteed the Crow 38 million acres of territory, but with the more numerous Lakota and Cheyenne settled to the south and east, it was not long before Crow lands were invaded. Through the right of conquest the Cheyenne and Lakota claimed much of the Crow's ancestral land, and pushed them ever westward. The second Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed in 1868, reduced even further what was left of the Crow's territory to just over 8 million acres. Subsequent Acts of Congress reduced the Crow's territory and by 1904 only 2.3 million acres remained located in present day Montana.</English>

		<German>[TAB] Die Crow sind auch als die Apsaalooke oder die Absaroka bekannt, was in ihrer eigenen Sprache Siouan 'Sperbervolk' oder 'Vogelvolk' bedeutet. Die Franzosen waren die ersten Europ&#228;er, die Mitte des 18ten Jahrhunderts auf die Crow trafen. Diese &#252;bersetzten deren Namen f&#228;lschlicherweise als 'Kr&#228;henvolk'. Diese falsche &#252;bersetzung wurden von den Engl&#228;ndern als 'Crow' &#252;bernommen.[PARAGRAPH:1] Die Crow siedelten in den Great Plains im Yellowstone River Tal, obwohl sie urspr&#252;nglich wohl aus der Gegend des Ohio Tals stammen und weiter westlich zogen um den besser bewaffneten Cree und Ojibwas auszuweichen und dann durch Cheyenne und Sioux sogar noch weiter westlich gezwungen wurden. Nachdem sie 1743 auf die Europ&#228;er trafen, erwarben die Crow bald Pferde und wurden geschickte Reiter. Sie wurden jedoch oft von Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Pawnee, Ute und Lakota St&#228;mmen &#252;berfallen, die lieber Pferde stahlen, als sie selbst zu z&#252;chten. [PARAGRAPH:1] 1851 garantierte der Vertrag von Fort Laramie mit den United States den Crow 38 Millionen Acres Territorium aber aufgrund der zahlenm&#228;ssig &#252;berlegenen Lakota und Cheyenne, die s&#252;dlich und &#246;stlich davon siedelten wurde dieses Gebiet bald umk&#228;mpft und teilweise verloren. Durch das Recht der Eroberung beanspruchten die Cheyenne und Lakota bald einen Gossteil des Landes der Vorfahren der Crow und zwangen sie immer weiter westlich. Der zweite Vertrag von Fort Laramie im Jahre 1868 reduzierte das verbliebene Land der Crow sogar noch weiter auf nunmehr lediglich 8 Millionen Acres. Weitere Beschl&#252;sse des Kongresses liesen dieses Gebiet bis 1904 auf lediglich 2.3 Millionen Acres im heutingen Montana schrumpfen.</German>

		<English>[TAB] The Blackfoot Confederacy or Niitsitapi (meaning original people) consists of the North Peigan, South Peigan, Kainai Nation  and the Siksika Nation, though only the Siksika are known as the Blackfoot, the name allegedly coming from the black dyed soles of their moccasins. [PARAGRAPH:1] Introduced to horses in the first decades of the 18th century, the Blackfoot quickly adopted a life on horseback and began to drive the hostile Shoshone and Arapaho from the Northwestern Plains in order to secure an adequate supply of the animal, often engaging in horse raiding parties against neighboring tribes. By the middle of the 18th century they had made contact with Europeans from Hudson's Bay Company, and in 1806 made their first recorded meeting with European Americans when they encountered the Lewis and Clark expedition. [PARAGRAPH:1] Smallpox epidemics depopulated the tribe through the 1800's, during the 1837 epidemic alone, approximately 6,000 members of the tribe died. Weakened by such epidemics, the Blackfoot were unable to prevent the increasing numbers of white settlers encroaching upon their lands and decimating the bison population, their primary food source. Facing a dwindling food supply the Blackfoot signed the Lame Bull Treaty of 1855 with the United States, which promised the Blackfoot 20,000 Dollar annually in goods and services on the condition that much of their territory become a common hunting grounds for other neighboring tribes and that whites be allowed to settle within Blackfoot lands. The last decades of the 19th century witnessed the further decline of the Blackfoot as their population continued to fall, and their lands were further reduced without approval or consultation by the United States. By the 1880's only the Pikuni remained in Montana, with the Kainai, Siksika, and Piegan moving to Canada in the hopes of receiving fairer treatment and preserving their culture.</English>

		<German>[TAB] Die Blackfoot Konf&#246;deration besteht aus den Nord-Peigan, S&#252;d-Peigan, der Kainai Nation und der Siksika Nation, obwohl eigentlich nur die Siksika als Blackfoot bekannt sind, was sich angeblich von der schwarzen Sohle ihrer Mokasins ableitete. [PARAGRAPH:1] Nach der ersten Begegnung mit Pferden in den ersten Dekaden des 18ten Jahrhunderts, &#252;bernahmen die Blackfoot schnell ein Leben auf dem Pferder&#252;cken und begannen die feindlichen Shoshone und Arapaho von den nordwestlichen Ebenen zu verdr&#228;ngen um sich eine adequate Versorgung mit Pferden zu sichern. Oft brachen sie zu Angriffen auf um Pferde von den benachbarten St&#228;mmen zu stehlen. Mitte des 18ten Jahrhunderts hatten sie Europ&#228;er der Hudson's Bay Company getroffen. 1806 fand das erste aufgezeichnete Treffen mit Amerikanern statt, als sie auf die Expedition von Lewis and Clark trafen. [PARAGRAPH:1] Pcken-Epidemien entv&#246;lkerten den Stamm um nach 1800. Alleine die Epidemie 1837 t&#246;tete ungef&#228;hrt 6000 Mitglieder des Stammes. Durch solche Ereignisse geschw&#228;cht konnten die Blackfoot gegen die wachsende Zahl der weissen Siedler auf ihrem Land und die Dezimierung der Bison Herden, ihre prim&#228;re Nahrungsquelle, kaum noch etwas unternehmen. Im Angesicht der schwindenden Nahrungsversorgung unterzeichneten die Blackfoot den Lame Bull Vertrag von 1855 mit den United States, der den Blackfoot 20.000 Dollar j&#228;hrlich in G&#252;tern und Dienstleistungen versprach, jedoch unter den Bedingungen, dass ihr Territorium als gemeinsames Jagdgebiet mit den benachbarten St&#228;mmen dienen sollte und dass die Weissen M&#228;nner auf Blackfoot Land siedeln durfen. Die letzten Dekaden des 19ten Jahrhunderts bezeugten den fortschreitenden Niedergan der Blackfoot. Um 1880 waren nur noch die Pikuni in Montana geblieben und die Kainai, Siksika, und Piegan nach Kanada geflohen. Dort hofften sie auf bessere Behandlung und eine M&#246;glichkeit ihre Kultur und Lebensart zu erhalten.</German>

Sogar das Jahr ihres Todes kann lediglich zwischen 1836 und 1850 gesch&#228;tzt werden. Urspr&#252;nglich als Brown Weasel Woman bekannt, zeigte Running Eagle bereits in jungen Jahren ein herausragendes Talent f&#252;r die Jagd und die Reiterei. Mit 15 begleitete sie ihren Vater bereits auf Jagdausfl&#252;gen und rettete ihn eines Tages sogar vor der Gefangennahme als sein Pferd von einem feindlichen Stamm erschossen wurde. Ihre ersten Kriegserfahrungen sammelte sie gegen die Crow, als diese mehrere Pferde ihres Stammes gestohlen hatten.

		<German>[TAB] Die Guaymi Indianer waren traditionell in den entlegenen Gegenden von Bocas Del Toro, Chiriqui und Veraguas beheimatet. Ihr Territorium war unterteilt durch die Cordillera Zentralgebirgskette des heutigen Panama und Costa Rico, was dazu f&#252;hrte, dass die Guaymi auf zwei sehr unterschiedliche klimatischen und &#246;kologische  Gebiete verteilt waren. Die Guaymi auf der Pazifikseite der Gebirgskette lebten verteilt und abgeschieden, wohingegen die Guaymi auf der Atlantikseite der Gebirgskette in vergleichsweise bev&#246;lkerungsreichen Gebieten lebten.[PARAGRAPH:1] Die Spanier erlangten den ersten Kontakt mit den Guaymi in den fr&#252;hen 1500ern aber Versuche sie zu unterwerfen oder zu erobern blieben erfolglos. Nach einer Periode des bewaffneten Konflikts versuchten die Spaniern die Guaymi zu bewegen in gr&#246;sseren Siedlungen zu leben, die durch Missionen kontrolliert wurden. Aber auch diese Vorgehen war nur wenig erfolgreich. Einige Indianer konvertierten zwar zum Christentum und verschmolzen letztlich auch mit den spanischen Kolonisten, die meisten Guaymi zogen sich aber weiter in die Abgeschiedenheit des Regenwaldes zur&#252;ck.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB] The Guaymi Indians were traditionally located in the remote regions of Bocas Del Toro, Chiriqui and Veraguas. Their territory was divided by the Cordillera Central mountain range of modern day Panama and Costa Rico, resulting in the Guaymi being divided between two areas that were climatically and ecologically different. The Guaymi on the Pacific side of the range found themselves scattered throughout small hamlets in remote regions, whereas the Guaymi on the Atlantic side remained in more populated coastal regions. [PARAGRAPH:1] The Spanish first contacted the Guaymi in the early 1500's but attempts to subdue and conquer them largely failed. After a period of armed conflict, Spanish policy resorted to trying to group the Guaymi into settlements controlled by missions. This policy enjoyed only limited success.

		<English>[TAB] The Tarascans were a pre-Columbian civilization whose territory at the time of the Spanish conquest was the second largest state in Mesoamerica. According to the Relacion de Michoacan, a 14th century leader of the P'orhepecha people, named Tariacuri forged the tribes around Lake Patzcuaro into the Tarascan state, placing his sons as overlords to newly acquired territory. Tariacuri died in 1350, but his sons continued their father's work, incorporating the Tarascan Sierra and the Balsas River into the Tarascans expanding sphere of influence. [PARAGRAPH:1] From the mid 15th century until the arrival of the Spanish, the Tarascans found themselves competing against the expanding empire of the Aztecs in a series of wars. The Tarascan empire blocked Aztec expansion to the northwest, fortifying and patrolling their frontiers against attacks from ethnic groups allied with or subjugated to the Aztecs. [PARAGRAPH:1] Hearing of the defeat of the Aztecs, Tangaxuan II, the last Cazonci of the Tarascans, sent emissaries with gifts to the Spanish. Interested by gifts of gold, the Cortes sent a Spanish force under Cristobal de Olid in 1522 to the Tarascan capital of Tzintzuntzan. Tangaxuan submitted to Spanish authority in return for maintaining a large degree of autonomy over his people, and for the next few years both he and the Spanish considered themselves rulers of the empire, with each collecting tribute from the populace. By 1530 the Spanish realized that Tangaxuan was still in effect in control of his empire and dispatched the conquistador Nuno de Guzman to execute him. With the death of Tangaxuan, the Tarascans empire quickly collapsed losing their independence to the Spanish. In 1543 it officially became the governorship of Michoacan.</English>

		<German>[TAB] Die Tarascans waren eine pre-columbianische Zivilisation deren Territorium zur Zeit der Spanischen Eroberung das zweit gr&#246;sste in Mittelamerika war. Der 'Relacion de Michoacan' zufolge, vereinte im 14ten Jahrhundert ein F&#252;hrer der P'orhepecha namens Tariacuri die St&#228;mme um den Lake Patzcuaro zum Staat der Tarascans und setzte seinen Sohn als Oberf&#252;hrer des neu erworbenen Gebietes ein. Tariacuri starb 1350, aber sein Sohn setzte seine Arbeit fort und f&#252;gte weitere Gebiete der wachsenden Einflussphere hinzu. [PARAGRAPH:1] Ab Mitte des 15ten Jahrhunderts bis zur Ankunft der Spaniern befanden die Tarascans sich in einem Wettstreit um die Vorherrschaft in diesem Gebiet mit den ebenfalls stark expandierenden Imperium der Azteken, der auch in einer Reihe von Kriegen ausgetragen wurde. Die Tarascans blockierten eine weitere Ausdehnung der Azteken in den Nordwesten und befestigten ihre Grenzen gegen ethnische Gruppen, die mit den Azteken verb&#252;ndet oder von diesen unterworfen waren. [PARAGRAPH:1] Nachdem Tangaxuan II, der letzte Cazonci der Tarascans, von der Niederlange der Azteken geh&#246;rt hatte, schickte er Abgesandte mit Geschenken zu den Spaniern. Durch die Geschenke aus Gold angelockt, entsandte Cortes 1522 eine spanische Streitmacht untder dem Kommmando von Cristobal de Olid nach Tzintzuntzan, der Hauptstadt der Tarascans. Tangaxuan unterwarf sich der spanischen Authorit&#228;t um einen teilweise Autonomie f&#252;r sein Volk erhalten zu k&#246;nnen. 1530 erkannten die Spanier, dass Tangaxuan tats&#228;chlich noch die volle Kontrolle &#252;ber sein Imperium hielt und entsandten den Conquistador Nuno de Guzman um ihn hinzurichten. Mit dem Tod von Tangaxuan kollabierte das Imperium der Tarascans schnell und verlor jegliche Unabh&#228;ngigkeit an die Spaniern. 1543 wurde es offiziell zum Gouverneursbezirk Michoacan.</German>

		<Spanish>[H1]Erendira[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Princess of the Tarascans[NEWLINE]Lived: [\BOLD]1503-1530?[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Erendira was a princess of the Tarascan people. She was 16 or 17 years old when the Spanish came to Mexico. After the downfall of their enemies the Aztecs, her uncle Tangaxuan II surrendered full autonomy of his kingdom, opting to rule with the Spanish, but was eventually executed by Spanish Conquistadores in 1530.[PARAGRAPH:1] Little is known of Erendiras role during this period, some legends and oral traditions claim that she rallied and led a military force that attacked the Spaniards, and that she personally killed a Conquistador and took his horse, later using the animal to teach her people how to ride, though there is no historical evidence to support this. As in life, Erendiras fate is also shrouded in mystery. Several stories claimed she committed suicide, others that she retreated to the mountains to train her people to fight, and a further story states that she was kidnapped by her own people and put into a temple so that the Spaniards would never find her. The only certainty historians and scholars have is that soon after the fall of the Tarascan empire, Erendiras name disappeared from historical records.</Spanish>

		<German>[TAB] Die Omagua, auch als Cambeba bekannt, waren auf zwei grosse Gruppierungen innerhalb des Amazonas Gebietes verteilt. Die eine Gruppe siedelte am oberen Napo und die andere am oberen Amazon. Bis zum 17ten Jahrhundert war der obere Amazonas fast vollst&#228;ndig durch die Omagua besiedelt. [PARAGRAPH:1] Die ersten signifikanten Berichte &#252;ber die Omagua wurden von Gaspar de Carvajal, einem Dominikanischen Priester, aufgezeichnet, der 1542 die Expedition von Francisco de Orellana begleitete, die entlang des Amazonas reiste. Carvajal berichtete von einer bev&#246;lkerungsreichen und organisierten Gesellschaft, die hunderte von Meilen entlang des Amazonas kontrollierte, schrieb jedoch sehr wenig &#252;ber die Menschen des Amazonas selbst, was haupts&#228;chlich daran lag, dass diese versuchten ihn zu t&#246;ten. Orellanas Gruppe erhielt einen eisigen Empfang durch die Omagua, die unaufh&#246;rlich die Spanier angriffenund viele t&#246;teten oder verwundeten. Um Vorr&#228;te zu erhalten befahl Orellana seinen M&#228;nnern in seiner Verzweiflung die D&#246;rfer dieser Ureinwohner anzugreifen. Am 21. Mai 1542 passierte Orellana den M&#252;ndung des Madeira und lies die Machipara und Omagua Gebiete hinter sich. Orellana starb 1546 bei seiner zweiten Reise in den Amazonas.[PARAGRAPH:1] Pedro de Ursua, der Geschichten &#252;ber den Reichtum der Omagua geh&#246;rt hatte, f&#252;hrte 1560 eine weitere Expedition entlang des Amazonas. Ausser Ger&#252;chten &#252;ber die mystische Stadt El Dorado fand er nichts.[PARAGRAPH:1] Im 16ten und 17ten Jahrhundert f&#252;hrte Krankheiten, die durch die Europ&#228;er eingeschleppt worden waren zu einem Bev&#246;lkerungskollaps unter den Omagua, worauf diese ihre St&#228;dte verliesen, in den Regenwald flohen und einen nomadischen Lebensstil annahmen.</German>

His attempts were not successful but the incessant hostility the Omagua dealt the Spanish, was enough to convince Orellana to move swiftly through their territory. It was probably warriors from one of the Omagua tribes who displaying long hair and bone earrings, were likely mistaken as women warriors, fueling the story that would eventually give the region its name, Amazon, after the Greek legend.</English>

Trotz des Fehlens einer zentralen Organisation waren die Mapuche erfolgreich darin, sich gegen eine Unterwerfung durch ihre viel gr&#246;sseren Nachbarn die Inka zu wehren. [PARAGRAPH:1] Nach der Eroberung Chiles durch die Spanier im sp&#228;ten 16ten Jahrhundert fuhren die Mapuche 300 Jahre erfolgreich damit fort das spanische Eindringen in ihr Territorium abzuwehren.

Im Chilenischen Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskrieg 1810-26 unterst&#252;tzen Mapuche Anf&#252;hrer beide Seiten, die Spanier, wie auch die Chilenen, spieleten diese gegeneinander aus und suchten ihre eigenen Vorteile. Nach der Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Chiles, blieben die Mapuche, die haupts&#228;chlich in Araucania und Patagonia lebten, weitgehend autonom. Dies &#228;nderte sich erst durch die Chilenische Unterdr&#252;ckung und die Argentinische Eroberung im sp&#228;ten 19ten Jahrhundert, als sie in Reservate umgesiedelt wurden.</German>

Captured as a boy in 1546, Lautaro, became the personal servant of Don Pedro de Valdivia, Spanish conqueror of Chile. While in captivity Lautaro learned the military practice and tactics of the Spanish army. Escaping the Spanish in 1552, Lautaro returned to his people just as they had decided to make war and expel the Spanish invaders from their lands. Leading 6,000 men he attacked the Spanish garrison of Fort Tucapel, forcing the Spanish to retreat and then defeating a smaller Spanish army sent to retake the fort. During this battle his former master Pedro de Valdivia who led the Spanish forces was captured and killed. [PARAGRAPH:1] Given the Mapuche tradition that dictated a lengthy victory celebration, Lautaro was unable to immediately follow up on his success at Tucapel. However, the following year saw further success against the Spanish at the Battle of Marihuenu, and the burning of the city of Concepcion. Despite famine and a smallpox epidemic that reduced his army's size, Lautaro again attacked Concepcion in 1555, and then fought the Spanish at the Battle of Peteroa, although this time he was forced to retreat in order to save his army. In the spring of 1557, Lautaro decided to attack Santiago. Yet his plans were forestalled at the Battle of Mataquito, where a surprise Spanish attack on his encampment saw Lautaro killed and his forces decisively beaten. After the battle, Lautaro's head was cut off displayed in Santiago's plaza.</English>

		<German>[H1]Lautaro[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Toqui der Mapuche[NEWLINE]Lebte: [\BOLD]1534-1557[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Lautaro war ein junger Milit&#228;rbefehlshaber der Mapuche, der im Arauco Kriege gegen die Spanier k&#228;mpfte. 1546 als Junge gefangen genommen, wurde Lautaro der pers&#246;nliche Diener von Don Pedro de Valdivia, spanischer Eroberer von Chile. W&#228;hrend seiner Gefangenschaft lernte er die milit&#228;rischen Praktiken und Taktiken der spanischen Armee. Nach seiner Flucht vor den Spaniern 1552, kehrte Lautaro zu seinem Volk zur&#252;ck als diese gerade beschlossen hatten gegen die Spanier Krieg zu f&#252;hren um sie von ihrem Land zu vertreiben. Mit 6000 Mann griff er die Garnison Fort Tucapel an, zwang die Spanier zum R&#252;ckzug und besiegte eine kleinere Armee, die das Fort wieder einnehmen sollte. W&#228;hrend dieser Schlacht wurde sein fr&#252;herer Herr Pedro de Valdivia, der die spanischen Truppen f&#252;hrte, gefangen und sp&#228;ter get&#246;tet. [PARAGRAPH:1] Aufgrund der Mapuche Tradition, die auf diesen Sieg eine lange Siegesfeier forderte, konnten Lautaro seinen Sieg jedoch nicht gleich weiter ausnutzen. Jedoch erlangte er im folgenden Jahre weitere Erfolge gegen die Spanier bei der Schlacht von Marihuenu und bei der Niederbrennung der Stadt Concepcion. Trotz Hunger und einer Pockenepidemie, die seine Armee stark reduzierten, griff Lautaro 1555 Concepcion erneut an und k&#228;mpfte dann gegen die Spanier in der Schlacht von Peteroa, war jedoch dieses Mal gezwungen selbst den R&#252;ckzug anzutreten.Im Fr&#252;hjahr 1557 entschied Lautaro Santiago anzugreifen. Sein Plan wurde jedoch durch die Schlacht von Mataquito verhindert, als ein spanischer &#252;beraschungsangriff zu einer entscheidenden Niederlage seiner Truppen und dem Tod von Lautaro selbst f&#252;hrte. Nach der Schlacht wurde der abgetrennte Kopf von Lautaro auf dem Plaza in Santiago aufgestellt.</German>
